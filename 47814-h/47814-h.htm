<h2>PREFACE.</h2>

<hr />


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Writer of the following Diary has
frequently been requested to have a few copies printed for circulation
amongst her friends; she has now acceded to their request, but wishes
it to be understood that the Diary is in its original wording, as
it was written by her day by day at Lucknow, with no attempts at
embellishment. The names of those who were actors in the fearful scenes
have been omitted, from a feeling of delicacy towards some who are
still alive.</p>

<p>The writer is also indebted to her husband, who commanded one of
the outposts throughout the siege, for the accuracy of the statements
of some of the events that did not come immediately under her own
observation.</p>

<h2>THE SIEGE OF LUCKNOW.</h2>

<hr />


<p>1857. May 15th, Friday. I spent the day with the B&mdash;&mdash;'s
of the 71st N.I., he acting Brigade-Major of Lucknow: while sitting
at dinner he told us of the horrible news from Meerut and Delhi; it
was rather alarming for one living alone as I was, my husband being on
city duty. Mr. B&mdash;&mdash; walked home with me about half-past 8,
at 9 I went to bed, taking good care to have a shawl and dressing-gown
close to the bed. Charlie's orderly slept in the verandah with the
servants, as he had done all the week; the B&mdash;&mdash;'s had kindly
offered me a bed, but I had declined it. I had one door, as usual, open
close to the bedroom at which the punkah-wallah pulled the punkah; the
other two were sleeping by him; the watchman, bearer, orderly, and two
doggies, forming quite a guard round the door: the Ayah and her child
slept in a room adjoining; and, notwithstanding the alarm, I think I
never slept sounder in my life.</p>

<p>Saturday, May 16th. I rose soon after gun-fire, and sent off
Charlie's provisions for the day, bread <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>and butter, quail,
mango-fool, and a few vegetables, and then sat in the garden and had
my coffee; at 7 went into the house and prepared for a visit to the
city, breakfasted at 10, and started at 11. I found Charlie had been
with Sir Henry Lawrence, who was making admirable preparations in case
of a rise here; Charlie said the old man was resting by a watercourse
in the garden with quite a little party around him, he telling them
all he knew, but advising them to spread the bad news as little as
possible; and then consulting with them about precautionary measures,
not objecting to a suggestion from even a captain, but catching at
anything he thought good. I could see that Charlie felt perfect
confidence in him; but I also saw that he thought very seriously of
the state the country was in, for his remark was that we were in the
position of a man sitting on a barrel of gunpowder. I sat talking with
him till 1 o'clock, and then went over to the G&mdash;&mdash;'s, as
I had promised to spend the day with them. I found them in an awful
state of alarm&mdash;talking of these murders at Delhi, and wondering
if So-and-So had escaped. Miss N&mdash;&mdash; had a violent sick
headache from the fright. At 2 Charlie came, and at 3 we tiffed; but
Mr. G&mdash;&mdash; was so busy he could scarcely stay two minutes,
and all the time was talking of the preparations. The Residency
was being turned out to form a place of safety for the ladies and
the sick. Charlie had to <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7"
id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>leave early to superintend arrangements
also. About half-past 5 I returned to his quarters, for I longed for
a little talk with him before I went home. The heat had been intense
all day, and the constant talking about these murders had made me feel
quite uncomfortable. Charlie was still with his guards and did not
return home for some time, so I lay down quietly on his bed. I felt
so nervous that, when he did return, I begged him to let me stay in a
chair by him all night. However, he talked and reasoned with me and
I got better. He told me two companies of the 32nd Queen's were just
coming into the banquetting house, and the sick from the hospital;
also a lot of women and children into some rooms under his quarters.
He made me a cup of tea and then would not let me stay any longer,
as it was getting dusk, and Sir Henry just driving up at the moment,
I started, as Charlie had to superintend the arrival of the troops.
Just outside the city my carriage had to wait to let a regiment of
Irregular Cavalry pass&mdash;Captain Gr&mdash;&mdash;'s. They were to
be stationed at the Dawk Bungalow between the city and Cantonments, to
keep up communication between the two. Instead of going home I drove
to the B&mdash;&mdash;'s, for I was afraid of getting nervous again,
sitting by myself. They were very glad to see me and again offered me a
bed, but after taking ices with them I returned, telling them in case
of alarm I should rush over to them, as our <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>bungalows adjoined each
other. At home I had another cup of tea, for the heat and excitement
gave one intense thirst. About 9 I went to bed, taking care to have
an Affghan knife (a kind of dagger) close to me. I started at a few
noises, but soon slept soundly, and fortunately heard nothing of an
alarm that was given by an artilleryman of Captain Simons'&mdash;a
Native&mdash;that the 13th were up in arms and were going to murder
their officers. The Brigadier rode off to the lines and sent for the
Adjutant and Captain Wilson, when it was discovered that the report had
been caused by the preparations making for a company going off with
Captain Francis to the Muchee Bawun. They walked through the lines and
saw that all was right, and the Brigadier returned home; but it caused
such a panic amongst some of the ladies that several rushed off to the
Cantonments Residency and slept there.</p>

<p>Sunday, May 17th. I rose at gun-fire, and after sending off
provisions to Charlie, went to church at 6, and while there seven
companies of the 32nd Queen's entered Cantonments. I breakfasted at
10, and then finished my overland letters. While writing them there
came a note from Mrs. A&mdash;&mdash;, asking me to spend the day
and night with them if I felt nervous; but I declined. Sir Henry had
forty of our men (the 13th) up as a guard at the Residency, after the
false report of them during the night, and told them he was perfectly
satisfied <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a>
</span>with them; that he had been so much pleased with them
since he had been at Lucknow that he intended writing to Calcutta and
stopping all the Raviel Pindee affair. At 3 I dined, and then lay
down intending to go to church, but just before the time there was an
immense deal of riding and driving about, and I saw a horse battery
gallop off, which I took for the European battery, that I expected
something must be up in the city. I wrote off to the B&mdash;&mdash;'s
for news, and also sent a note off to Charlie, but I got such a
headache with the start that I did not feel fit for church. It proved
to be an Oude Irregular battery going off to be stationed at the Dawk
Bungalow. The B&mdash;&mdash;'s again pressed me to sleep at their
house, although the Padre and his wife (Mr. and Mrs. Harris) were
already there. While taking tea about 8, the bearer came in to tell me
the subadar of Charlie's company had sent his salaam, and would send
up two Sepoys to guard my house at night. I hesitated a little, but
agreed at last to have them, thinking I had better not show any want
of confidence in the men, although it might be a great risk in these
treacherous times. However, I wrote off to Captain W&mdash;&mdash;,
asking if he thought they might be trusted? Captain W&mdash;&mdash; was
from home, but the Adjutant wrote and said I need not hesitate&mdash;he
felt perfect confidence in the men; so they came and I retired to
rest, making my usual defensive preparations, and slept soundly.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>
<p>Monday, May 18th. Rose at gun-fire, and while I
was arranging my flowers and taking coffee in the garden, the Adjutant
called to see if I were all safe&mdash;and then came a note from Mrs.
P&mdash;&mdash;, saying she had heard we were to be turned out of our
house to make room for the troops&mdash;and offering us two rooms. I
declined, having received no orders to turn out. The Adjutant had told
me the 13th mess-house had been given up to the European soldiers, and
that several of the bachelors had offered their houses. About half-past
7 Charlie came home, to my great delight; the Europeans took possession
of the mess-house and houses all round us, and we were well guarded:
the day passed off without alarm.</p>

<p>Tuesday, May 19th. Charlie rose early, and went off to the lines
to see after the Sepoys; on his return we went and took chota
hazree (early breakfast) with the A&mdash;&mdash;'s, and heard
there that Mrs. Chambers, wife of the Adjutant of the 11th N.I. had
been murdered at Delhi by a butcher out of the bazaar; but that the
wretch had afterwards been caught by a sweeper, and roasted alive.
We are beginning to receive a few reports of the sad massacre, but
at present it is not known who have perished or who have escaped; it
is true that Mr. Willoughby blew up the magazine at Delhi himself.
This morning a bill was found stuck on some posts in the cavalry
lines, calling on all good Mussulmen to join in this rise; the
cavalry <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
brought it to their officers.<a name="FNanchor_1_1"
id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
After breakfast came a Sepoy to Charlie to tell him that there was a
panic in one of the bazaars, and that the people were all shutting
up their shops and running away. Charlie went to the Brigade-Major,
and soon after we saw Sir Henry drive by, and could see from our
drawing-room window that the 32nd soldiers in the mess-house were all
armed and accoutred, and a sergeant was stationed at the corner of the
house to give the word; but after a time it subsided, and we heard the
people were returning to their shops: the officer who had charge of
the bazaars had been down with them, trying to make them comprehend
that there was no cause for alarm. It originated in a Chuprasee (a
Government servant) buying melons; he tried to get more than he ought
for his money, which caused a little hubbub, and there being an order
now-a-days to take up any one who makes a disturbance in the bazaar,
two mounted Sepoys rode up to take him; he rushed off crying out
"Shut your shops! shut your shops!" and the poor frightened wretches
did it without question; the man was made prisoner, and so it ended.
I have only named it to show the state of excitement we were in.
While this was occurring, Capt. W&mdash;&mdash; came in and brought
us a budget of Delhi news, written down by the Allyghur magistrate;
it is said a party of officers were seen going into Kurnaul, <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>eighty
miles north of Delhi; so it is possible they may be fugitives from
Delhi&mdash;I trust so. Captain W&mdash;&mdash; also told us that
Brigadier H&mdash;&mdash; was under arrest at Meerut. There must have
been great delay and mismanagement there, for the insurgents were in
Meerut all Sunday night, burning and murdering, and did not reach
Delhi till 4 o'clock the Monday morning. Captain W&mdash;&mdash;
complimented me on my remaining alone in the house during the panic;
Charlie also seems well pleased that I have done so. In the evening
we took our usual drive; our band was playing at the band-stand, but
very few were driving about. We went to bed in peace&mdash;Charlie
having his double-barrelled gun, loaded with a charge of shot, by the
bedside; he says it is more useful than a bullet, for it would disable
several, whereas a bullet might miss altogether: my weapon is the
Affghan dagger, just suited to me, being neither too large nor heavy. I
only trust we may have no occasion to use them, but one cannot be too
guarded in these treacherous times.</p>

<p>Wednesday, May 20th. Charlie went off before gun-fire with Captain
W&mdash;&mdash; to the city to see the Muchee Bawun, where Captain
F&mdash;&mdash; is stationed. He is there with two companies of
Natives, and there are also two Queen's officers and seventy men, also
two guns in position besides field pieces, one to sweep the whole
entrance street of Lucknow, the other the iron bridge; and then there
are some Oude <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]
</a></span>Irregular troops: an Engineer officer was making the
place habitable for them. While there, Sir Henry drove up, and scolded
first this one, and then that, and then away again to superintend some
other arrangements. The day passed off without alarm. At the band
in the evening Charlie went over to the G&mdash;&mdash;'s carriage,
and heard that the Sappers (Natives) sent from Koorkee to Meerut,
had proved treacherous, but that they had suffered severely for it,
for in the same regiment was also a great number of Europeans, who
had killed and wounded great numbers of them. He also heard that the
Commander-in-Chief was marching down to Delhi, that he was at Kurnaal
on the 18th; that he would have eight European regiments, and that he
was bringing with him all the officers who had gone on leave to Simlah.
Delhi is on the Grand Trunk road from Simlah.</p>

<p>Thursday, May 21st. While Charlie was dressing, just after gun-fire,
to go and inspect his company, there came a notice round that all
officers were to assemble at Sir Henry's at half-past 6. It was to
inform them that he (Sir Henry) had been made Brigadier-General in
Oude; that he had all power entirely in his own hands to reward or
punish as he should think fit, without appealing to any higher power
whatever&mdash;the finest thing that could have been done, and we
cannot be too thankful for having such a man over us. Last <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>night
a light was put into one of our Native officer's huts, but fortunately,
it was put to leeward. No doubt the intention was for the fire to be
carried to some bungalow; but one of our Sepoys saw it, and ran and
pulled it off and smothered it, burning his hands in doing so&mdash;but
it looked well of the man. The day passed without alarm, but at the
band, our Doctor came up to the buggy, requesting us to take his wife
and child in for the night, as he said there was going to be a rise.
We went home and turned out Charlie's room for her, and placed a bed
in it. Just as we were sitting at tea, the servants came running in
giving an alarm of fire, and when we went out we saw the flames rising
up from, apparently, the next bungalow to ours but one. The wind was
high, and lay in the quarter to blow the sparks to us; Charlie sent
several of the servants up on our thatched roof, each with a gurra
of water. We quite looked for a disturbance now. Charlie took his
double-barrelled gun, and told me, if there were any, to take my
Affghan knife and escape at the back of the house over the garden wall
to the Residency&mdash;it is only about four feet. There is only the
road between us and the Residency, the garden wall of which is about
five feet, but I could manage both with a chain. However, all seemed
quiet, and, fortunately, it was the stables of a house which, being
tiled, the sparks were not thrown up so high as they would have been
from thatch, and in about <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15"
id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>an hour and a half we saw it subside.
Then came the Doctor and his family, in a fearful state of mind. We
tried to quiet them, for really we did not fear much now, the fire
having passed off without any rising; it was a good sign, and several
of our Sepoys had come to see if our house was all right. After
arranging Mrs. P&mdash;&mdash;'s room, Charlie and I went to bed; it
was past 10, and he was asleep in a few minutes. I listened for a time
thinking I heard noises in the Bazaar, but soon fell asleep, and the
night passed without further alarm.</p>

<p>Friday, May 22nd. Charlie went into the garden early, just as Sir
Henry was passing. Sir Henry called to him, and told him to go and
learn all he could about the fire, and whether the Sepoys worked to put
it out, and to come over to him at 7, when he would be back from the
city. I found my visitors had had a good night, so they dressed and
went home, and are to come again to-night. There are fourteen ladies
sleeping at the Residency here in Cantonments every night.</p>

<p>Saturday, May 23rd. The day passed without alarm, excepting that in
the afternoon I was by myself and heard such a tremendous noise that
I was quite frightened. It turned out to be at our mess-house. The
Colonel of the 32nd would have the thatched roof well saturated with
water in case of fire, and in the midst of it all a fire-engine rattled
up from the city (the first I ever saw in India), and in my alarm I
took it for a gun.</p> <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16"
id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>

<p>Sunday, May 24th. We went to church early, and the day passed off
quietly.</p>

<p>Monday, May 25th. We were aroused at 3 <span
class="smcap">A.M.</span> by a message coming for Charlie to go over
to Sir Henry. He dressed and went over immediately. I waited till
gun-fire, and then went into the garden to arrange my flowers, little
thinking what was coming. Charlie came back about half-past 5, when,
to my astonishment, he told me it was Sir Henry's express orders that
all ladies should leave Cantonments and go down to the Residency in
the city; so I suspected he had heard bad news.<a name="FNanchor_2_2"
id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
I commenced immediately collecting what I thought I should require,
and what I considered valuable, not knowing how long I should be
from home. The heat was intense, and I had to hurry my packing, for
Charlie had had an offer of a seat in the H&mdash;&mdash;'s carriage
for me, as he could not take me down himself, being Captain of the
week; and they were to call for me at half-past 7. He made me take
some coffee, and packed up what he could of eatables and drinkables,
not knowing how we should fare at the Residency. At the appointed
time the H&mdash;&mdash;'s and Mrs. B&mdash;&mdash; called for me,
and we drove to the city, passing innumerable coolies with beds
and baggage of all descriptions, carriages and buggies filled with
ladies and children, all off<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17"
id="Page_17">[17]</a></span> to the city&mdash;such a scene&mdash;and
when we drove up to the Residency everything was looking so warlike,
guns pointed in all directions, and barricades and European troops;
everywhere nothing but bustle and confusion. We then heard there
was hardly a room to be had&mdash;ladies had been arriving ever
since gun-fire&mdash;so Mr. H&mdash;&mdash; went over to see if Dr.
F&mdash;&mdash; could take us in. He came back saying he could, and
away we went, thankful to get into such good quarters. Two ladies
were there already, and five came after, with three children, so that
every room was full. This house, as well as <a id="corr6"></a>Mr.
G&mdash;&mdash;'s and Mr. O&mdash;&mdash;'s (both also full) are within
the Residency grounds, and are barricaded all round; still, in case of
disturbance, we have orders to assemble at the Residency. Of course,
there are all kinds of reports and alarms going about consequent on our
flight. The heat was intense; I never experienced anything like it: at
night it is fearful, I cannot sleep for it. Our beds are three under
one punkah. I and Mrs. A&mdash;&mdash; are with Mrs. F&mdash;&mdash; in
her room. In the other rooms they are as crowded, but it is nothing to
the Residency. Our party here is a very agreeable one. We meet at chota
hazree, and, after dressing, breakfast at 10. We then have working,
reading and music&mdash;there are some very good performers amongst our
party&mdash;lunch at 2, dine at half-past 7, and then the Padre reads
a chapter and prayers, and we retire.</p> <p><span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<p>Tuesday, May 26th. The day passed quietly. Several husbands
and fathers visited their beloveds, but mine could not leave his
station duty. In the evening I went to the Residency to see Mrs.
B&mdash;&mdash;, whose baby was dying. I never witnessed such a
scene&mdash;a perfect barrack&mdash;every room was filled with
six or eight ladies; beds all round, and perhaps a dining-table
laid for dinner in the centre&mdash;servants thick in all the
verandahs&mdash;numbers of the 32nd soldiers and their officers; and
underneath all, the women and children of the 32nd barracks&mdash;such
a hubbub and commotion! It is an upper storeyed house, but the upper
storey is not nearly so large as the under one, and yet in that,
including servants and children, there are ninety-six people living!
Poor Mrs. B&mdash;&mdash; was in great distress; she and another lady
had a small room to themselves, with her five children. I was quite
thankful I was not there: it was a complete rabbit warren. On my
return I found Dr. F&mdash;&mdash; and Mr. H&mdash;&mdash; had been to
Cantonments, and heard that the 13th Sepoys had taken up four city men,
one of whom attempted to stab Mr. C&mdash;&mdash;, the Adjutant.</p>

<p>Wednesday, May 27th. The day passed quietly. I went over to the
Residency to see Mrs. P&mdash;&mdash; and Mrs. A&mdash;&mdash; in
the evening, and found them in a small room with another lady.
Mrs. P&mdash;&mdash;'s child had bad fever&mdash;it was such a
scene&mdash;they were having a punkah put up, and their beds were so
thick you could hardly move, and scarcely a <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>breath of air to be had.
Such a hubbub all round&mdash;some parties were grouped in a circle
in the verandah, some in the compound&mdash;but it is impossible to
describe the scene; I can compare it to nothing but a rabbit warren.</p>

<p>Thursday, May 28th. The day passed as usual. In the evening
two of us drove with Dr. and Mrs. F&mdash;&mdash; to the <a
id="corr7"></a>Martinière College, he taking with him a very small
pistol, and concealed from view, on the coach-box, a double-barrelled
gun. The part of the city we drove through seemed perfectly quiet.</p>

<p>Friday, May 29th. About 5 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span> I drove
with Miss H&mdash;&mdash; to Cantonments, and had the inexpressible
delight of seeing Charlie again, and the poor doggies I thought would
have eaten me up. I had chota hazree with Charlie, and we sat chatting
till 7, when the H&mdash;&mdash;'s carriage came for me again. The
day passed quietly. Some of the party drove out with Dr. and Mrs.
F&mdash;&mdash;, in the evening, but I did not. Dr. F&mdash;&mdash;'s
elephant is brought every evening to the verandah, where we are
generally all assembled, to have his dinner. He has large cakes made
of 32lbs. of ottah (coarse flour). This evening he performed various
feats: taking the Mahout upon his back by his trunk, then putting out
his forepaw for the Mahout to climb up that way; roaring, when he
was told to speak, and then salaaming and taking his departure.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>

<p>Saturday, May 30th. I went down to Cantonments again with Miss
H&mdash;&mdash;, and Col. H&mdash;&mdash; told us if we liked to
remain till 11, he would take us back to the city himself. I was glad
to accede to it, but it was against orders, for we are only allowed
to go down to Cantonments morning and evening, and stay two hours. I
enjoyed my time with Charlie; had a delightful bath, and appreciated
the luxury of my own bathing and dressing rooms; then breakfasted
with Charlie, who did not like my remaining in Cantonments so long
against orders. The poor doggies were wild&mdash;"Prince," a little
Scotch terrier, seemed to think himself privileged to be saucy as
his mistress had come to see him, and got away under a sofa, and
growled, and bid defiance to the servant who came to take him away to
be washed, so that Charlie had to come to the rescue. However, the
whole time Charlie was in a fidget about my remaining against orders.
At 11 the carriage came. I little thought it was my last sight of the
pretty garden and the home I had spent so many happy hours in, and
of my poor little doggies. After taking up Col. H&mdash;&mdash; and
his daughter, who should we meet but Sir H. Lawrence, returning from
the city; and he stared me full in the face. I was in terror, for I
feared Charlie would get a wigging for letting me remain so long in
Cantonments, and he is always so particular not to disobey orders.
The day passed quietly. The <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21"
id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>elephant came to the verandah to be fed,
and we sat down to dinner, laughing and talking&mdash;quite a merry
party&mdash;when, about 9, the servants came running in, saying there
was a great deal of firing going on in the direction of Cantonments.
We all started up. Dr. F&mdash;&mdash; and Mr. H&mdash;&mdash; rushed
off to discover the truth of it, and sure enough there was artillery
and musketry plainly to be heard, and from the top of the house
tremendous fires could be seen blazing up. Dr. F&mdash;&mdash; at
first ordered us to get our bonnets and go to the Residency; then he
said we had better go down to the underground part of the house: and
he had all the doors locked, and they armed themselves. It was an
awful time for us who had our husbands in Cantonments, for there was
not a doubt but that the Native troops had risen, and were burning
and murdering. Dr. F&mdash;&mdash; then told us to get together a
little bundle of linen, and what we might require in case we were
ordered off to the Muchee Bawun&mdash;we might be kept there some
time&mdash;but it must be only a small bundle, that we could carry
in our hands. We did so, and then all collected in the dining-room,
awaiting our orders, Mrs. F&mdash;&mdash;'s baby asleep in the midst of
us; the suspense was fearful. About 2, came down Mr. J&mdash;&mdash;,
the commissariat officer, with a message from Sir Henry, that the
Native troops had risen, but that we had held our own, and the <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>rebels
had fled. Dr. F&mdash;&mdash; then said we had better all go and lie
down in our clothes, with our bundles ready, and he would call us if
there were any further alarm. We went; but I could only walk up and
down the room, thinking of Charlie, and whether he had been wounded.
Mrs. F&mdash;&mdash; gave me a cup of tea, and while I was drinking it
they came running in to tell me Charlie was all right. He had ridden
up with a despatch from Sir Henry for Mr. G&mdash;&mdash;, escorted
by twenty Irregular Cavalry men, and a few minutes after he made his
appearance. I never shall forget the moment. I could only thank God he
was safe. His trowsers, up to the knees, were covered with blood, but
it was from his horse having been shot in the nose. He himself had had
a most narrow escape; the Brigadier was shot about two yards from him.
Of course all the ladies in the house crowded round him, and his first
words were, "All belonging to the ladies in this house are safe." He
then mentioned the Brigadier's death, and Mr. G&mdash;&mdash;'s, of
the 71st N.I.; also, that Mr. C&mdash;&mdash; had been wounded in the
leg. They had just brought him down to the Residency, in Sir Henry's
carriage. I could only shudder to think what an escape my own dear
husband had had. He said they were sitting at mess when the alarm was
given, and that he rushed off to the Brigadier, being his orderly
officer that week. The Brigade-Major joined them, and they went into
the Lines, when the Sepoy of the 13th, who had been rewarded <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>a few
days previously, and who was carrying the Brigadier's gun, called
out, "Save yourself, Sahib; they are going to fire!" A volley was
fired, but the Brigadier was not hit then. Charlie was on foot;
he had tried to mount a horse of Capt. W&mdash;&mdash;'s, but it
had thrown him&mdash;most fortunately for him as it turned out
afterwards&mdash;then went on again and received another volley, and
then a third, and Charlie says it was most marvellous they were not
hit. They had then reached the European camp, when the Brigadier would
go a little further, although the soldiers warned him not to. A shot
immediately struck him in the breast, and he fell from his horse like
a stone&mdash;quite dead. Charlie ordered some European soldiers to
carry him into camp, which they did; and he said it was only from not
being mounted himself that he was not hit&mdash;they fired too high. He
and Mr. B&mdash;&mdash; rushed off, and Charlie's groom met him in the
bazaar with his horse. He lost Mr. B&mdash;&mdash; in the bazaar, but
dared not wait; they were all in arms around him. It was the 71st N.I.
that commenced the mutiny&mdash;they rushed off and got their arms, and
the bad ones of the other regiments joined them. However, the great
guns settled them, and they made off into the district. Sir Henry then
asked who would carry down a despatch to the city, and Charlie offered,
for he thought of me, so he galloped off with his twenty Sowars,<a
name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3"
class="fnanchor">[3]</a> <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24"
id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>leaving the bungalows burning on all sides
of him. He fancied not one would escape. Ours for that night did,
owing to Charlie's orderly telling the party of the 48th, who had
come to burn it, that there was a Havildar's party inside, who would
fire instantly; so they passed on to the next. This man got 100 <a
id="corr15"></a>rupees afterwards from Sir Henry for this. Charlie
did not go back to Cantonments that night, as his horse was quite
done up, and he had had leave to do as he liked. He went back to Mr.
G&mdash;&mdash;, and we all went to bed. Never shall I forget this
awful night, nor how much I have to thank God for having preserved my
dear one.</p>

<p>Sunday, May 31st. Charlie came over to breakfast with us; we all
then went into Dr. F&mdash;&mdash;'s room, and Mr. H&mdash;&mdash;
read prayers; Charlie then went to see if Sir Henry had arrived, and
I wrote my overland letters and was just closing them, when an order
came for all ladies to go over to the Residency, as they expected a
rise in the city; we collected our bundles, and, under a burning sun,
walked over to the Residency, where we were told not to congregate
too many in one part, as the building was not safe; every room in the
upper storey was crammed, we could hardly get space to put down our
bundles: at last Miss N&mdash;&mdash; offered me a corner in one room,
but the perfect Babel there was with the number of children and the
fearful heat, with no punkahs going, was enough to drive one wild. We
sat down <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a>
</span>in this miserable state all day; there was luncheon
going on when we arrived, and we were invited to partake, but Mrs.
F&mdash;&mdash; kindly sent over for one from her own house for us.
I saw my husband every now and then, but he was acting under Major
A&mdash;&mdash;. In the evening the two Padres tried to have prayers,
but we could scarcely hear them from the Babel of tongues all round
and the screams of so many children; it was perfect misery. I was
dying with thirst, and had nothing of my own to quench it; at last
a lady took pity on me, and ordered her servant to make me a cup of
tea&mdash;a perfect luxury. We heard firing going on all the evening;
it turned out to be an attack on the Dowlut Khana, but the rebels were
repulsed, several shot, and others taken prisoners, who were afterwards
hanged. Martial law is proclaimed now in Oude, so they are hanging
several night and morning at the Muchee Bawun. About 7, Sir Henry came
down from Cantonments with a large escort, and was received with great
cheering; four more guns came down with him; every preparation was
made, expecting an attack that night; every man was at his gun, and the
slow matches lighted in readiness. There was no chance of sleeping down
in this hot Babel, so I and several other ladies took our bedding up on
the roof and slept there; it was a lovely moonlight night, and never
shall I forget the scene. The panorama of Lucknow, from the top of the
Residency, is <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]
</a></span>splendid; and down immediately below us, in the compound,
we could see the great guns and all the military preparations; all,
every instant, expecting an attack, and firing going on in the
distance. However, I was so worn out with the previous night that I
lay down and was asleep in a second; of course I did not undress, nor
had I done so the night before. I started frequently, fancying I heard
the tramp of the mob coming; we had the two Padres up with us and
they determined to watch by turns. Mr. P&mdash;&mdash; began; he had
a double-barreled gun, pistol and sword, and walked round and round
for two hours, and then awoke Mr. H&mdash;&mdash;, but we could not
help laughing, for Mr. H&mdash;&mdash; was so sleepy he told him he
did not think there was any necessity for watching up there. I shall
never forget the night; the moon and stars were so brilliant overhead,
looking so peaceful in contrast to the scene below. I fixed up an
umbrella over my head to keep off the ill effects of the moon; every
hour the sentinels were calling to one another and answering, "All's
well!" It was certainly more a scene from romance than real life. Sir
Henry slept out, like the others, between two guns.</p>

<p>Monday, June 1st. As soon as it was light, I rolled up my bundle
of bedding and went down to find Charlie; he was just going off
to Cantonments with Sir Henry, being made Acting Adjutant <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>in the
room of Mr. C&mdash;&mdash;, and they have all orders to remain in
camp in Cantonments; so I must not expect to see him now. The heat
is fearful in tents by day&mdash;there are two or three companies
of Europeans and some guns, and all the Native troops who remained
staunch to us, encamped together; our treasure and regimental colours
are saved; the former entirely by Mr. L&mdash;&mdash;'s bravery. One
is hearing now of the wonderful escapes some of the officers had that
night; the only wonder is that so many escaped; numbers have lost their
all. To continue. Mrs. F&mdash;&mdash; gave me a cup of tea: one's
thirst is fearful in this intense heat and excitement; I contrived to
send a cup down to Charlie. Poor fellow! he has not undressed at night
for more than a week; he went back <a id="corr16"></a>in Sir Henry's
carriage, for his own horse is quite done up. Just as I was wondering
where I should find a corner to dress in, Dr. F&mdash;&mdash; gave us
notice that we might go back to his house, for he thought it safer
than the Residency, with that crowd; it was perfect paradise to get
back again, and I had a lovely bath. I could not do much throughout
the day, for I was overpowered with drowsiness; we had no alarms: at
night we hardly liked undressing, but I thought it would rest one
more, so I put on a thick dressing-gown and placed my bundle ready
and fell asleep. We were aroused by a slight alarm, but it ended in
nothing. I partly dressed, and lay down again. It was occasioned <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>by a sick
man, in his delirium, calling out "Murder!" However, it caused a great
commotion, and every one was ordered to arm himself; it only shows what
an excited state we are all in.</p>

<p>Tuesday, June 2nd. The day passed quietly. In the evening Mr.
C&mdash;&mdash; paid me a visit, and gave many particulars of that
awful night; he is come down on city duty.</p>

<p>Wednesday, June 3rd. The first news we heard from without was the
death of the Commander-in-Chief, from cholera, at Umballah; then
about 1 o'clock came Major B&mdash;&mdash; and Mr. P&mdash;&mdash;
to tell the F&mdash;&mdash;'s Dr. F&mdash;&mdash;'s brother had been
killed by the insurgents; it was a day of bad news: also poor Captain
H&mdash;&mdash;, who has left a widow and seven children, and Mr.
B&mdash;&mdash;, a newly-married man. I believe they removed poor
Mrs. H&mdash;&mdash; to Mrs. G&mdash;&mdash;'s before telling her the
sad news. As I and <a id="corr17"></a>Mrs. A&mdash;&mdash; occupied
Mrs. F&mdash;&mdash;'s room, we offered to give it up to her and her
husband, but they would not hear of it; we had no further alarm in the
city.</p>

<p>Thursday, June 4th. I rose as soon as it was light, to get a little
air; the heat is so intense in this house that this is the only
breath of air one gets in the day. While sitting in the garden, fifty
Europeans of the 84th arrived in dawk carriages, Dr. P&mdash;&mdash;
and Major G&mdash;&mdash; with them. Major G&mdash;&mdash;'s
regiment had mutinied, and they had with <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>difficulty escaped with
their lives. Dr. P&mdash;&mdash; said they expected an attack between
this and Cawnpore, so as there were four soldiers to each carriage, two
always kept watch outside with their muskets loaded, and the carriages
were kept all together. Poor Mrs. F&mdash;&mdash; was looking out her
mourning; it seemed so sad that neither she nor Dr. F&mdash;&mdash;
had a room to themselves. After dinner news was brought that the 41st
N.I. at Setapore had mutinied, and that the ladies and gentlemen
were flying, so Dr. F&mdash;&mdash; and Mr. G&mdash;&mdash; sent off
their carriages immediately to meet them; a party of gentlemen had
ridden off already, and Dr. F&mdash;&mdash; and Dr. P&mdash;&mdash;
followed them. At sunset I went over with Mr. C&mdash;&mdash; to
see Mrs. A&mdash;&mdash; and Mrs. P&mdash;&mdash;; the latter is in
great distress for clothing, having lost everything the night of
the mutiny, like many others. While I was sitting with them, the
fugitives drove in, bringing in news that Colonel B&mdash;&mdash;, the
commandant of the 41st, had been shot by his men; his poor daughter
was with the fugitives: there were many missing, and it was afterwards
known that all living in or near the Civil Lines perished, excepting
Sir M&mdash;&mdash; J&mdash;&mdash; and his sister, who formerly
resided here with their uncle, Mr. C. C. J&mdash;&mdash;, the chief
commissioner.</p>

<p>Friday, June 5th. Rose at gun-fire, for the heat is so unbearable
I am glad to get up. Several of the 32nd officers joined us while we
were sitting in the garden, and the discussion was, why the hanging
should be stopped? There has been none <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>the last two days, and
before that they were hanging six or eight morning and evening in front
of the Muchee Bawun. The day passed without alarm. In the evening, to
our surprise, we heard the remainder of the 48th N.I. were ordered to
Deriowbad for treasure; of course we concluded it was a great risk for
the officers, although they are the Sepoys that remained staunch at the
mutiny. It is quite risk enough being with them in Cantonments with
only a handful of Europeans. I went over to see Mrs. B&mdash;&mdash;,
who is in great distress, having just lost her baby. She told me of
her narrow escape the night of the mutiny in the Cantonments; she was
down there with all her children, although Sir H. L&mdash;&mdash; had
forbidden ladies to be there at night. She told me, she and the Major
were in bed when a Havildar came rushing in, begging her to fly, for
the Sepoys were up in the Lines, and immediately after the mutineers
came to the house and asked for the Sahib and Mem-Sahib; she fled with
her five children, escorted by three friendly Sepoys, first into the
servants' houses, but the bullets came whistling so thick that the
Sepoys cut a hole in the mud-wall for her to escape at the back. They
fled to a village, but the villagers came out and threatened to take
their lives if they remained, so they went and took refuge in a dry
nullah (a bed of a stream); it was about fifteen or twenty feet deep,
so that they had to sit and slide down the bank; the Sepoys lay <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>down
on the bank and watched; her poor baby had dysentery, and had nothing
on but its night-clothes: no wonder it died a day or two after; but,
then, she ought not to have been in Cantonments. She drove up to the
city next day, but Sir Henry was so angry with her for having disobeyed
his orders that he would not allow her an escort. Mrs. M&mdash;&mdash;,
the Pension Paymaster's wife, has lost everything&mdash;she says
50,000 rupees' worth of property&mdash;for the bungalow was their own,
and being stationary at Lucknow, they had everything in the greatest
luxury; she had an immense amount of jewellery. Miss N&mdash;&mdash;
spent the day with us.</p>

<p>Saturday, June 6th. Another quiet day. I had a great fright in the
afternoon, for a fire was seen in Cantonments. However, I got a note
from Charlie, saying all was quiet; the 71st Lines had been burnt
down.</p>

<p>Sunday, June 7th. Rose at gun-fire, and went to church with nearly
all our party, for Sir Henry said it was quite safe. The church is
in the entrenchment. We stayed to the Sacrament, and it was quite
comforting. The day passed quietly. Most attended service again in the
evening, for there were sentries round the church; but the heat was so
extreme I felt unequal to going.</p>

<p>Monday, June 8th. A quiet day. Firing has been heard for two
days at Cawnpore. In the <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32"
id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>evening a Mrs. A&mdash;&mdash;,
of the 41st, a fugitive from Setapore, called and gave a
description of the mutiny there; and a Mr. V&mdash;&mdash; came
in and reported he had seen the bodies of Mrs. C&mdash;&mdash;
and the two Miss J&mdash;&mdash;'s lying in the road.<a
name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4"
class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>Tuesday, June 9th. Another quiet day; no news. I went to see
Mrs. A&mdash;&mdash;, who had been very ill, but was better. Mrs.
F&mdash;&mdash; went to several of the ladies from Secroara, who are
living in the Begum Kotee (another house in the Residency compound
for the accommodation of the ladies) and told me she had seen Mrs.
B&mdash;&mdash; and Mrs. K&mdash;&mdash;; they were without even a
change of clothes. I think they came in from Secroara with the Setapore
party; Mrs. B&mdash;&mdash; had not even a change for her baby! They
are still going on making our entrenchment stronger and stronger;
two 18-pounders have been put in position, for the insurgents have
guns at Cawnpore from the Rajah of Bhitoor,<a name="FNanchor_5_5"
id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>
who has joined them. We dine now at 4 o'clock, and have tea and ices
in the garden in the evening; and, we are in luxury, compared with
most.</p>

<p>Wednesday, June 10th. Went into the garden early, and heard
that some women and children had been brought in from Setapore in
dhoolies (palanquins for the sick) led by a sergeant who had his arm
in splinters. They brought a frightful account of the atrocities
committed there&mdash;too <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33"
id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>barbarous and inhuman to be mentioned.
I sent plates, cups and saucers, &amp;c., &amp;c., to the Secroara
ladies, and linen to poor Mrs. B&mdash;&mdash;. We were told, at
breakfast, that we must not be alarmed if we heard a great explosion,
for they were going to blow up a gateway near us. They are clearing
as much as they can, a space around us, to give as little cover as
possible for the enemy to fire from, in case it comes to a siege. In
the evening, I and several others went over to the Begum's house, and
saw Mrs. K&mdash;&mdash; and Mrs. B&mdash;&mdash;; the place was very
dirty, but the room lofty and good. Mrs. F&mdash;&mdash; brought away
Mrs. B&mdash;&mdash; and four children to our house.</p>

<p>Thursday, June 11th. The atrocities committed at Setapore are
beyond belief; a whole heap of babies was found,&mdash;the poor little
creatures bayonetted and thrown on a heap. The ladies from Deriowbad
came in, and Mr. B&mdash;&mdash;, an artillery officer, from Secroara;
his artillerymen (Natives) made him come in, and actually gave him
fifty rupees for expenses on the road: so the rebels have his guns.
A sergeant-major, from Setapore, brought news that the treasury
there had been plundered, and that the rebels had then started for
Gondah, intending to loot that also. The poor ladies from Setapore and
Gondah were in a dreadful state about their husbands. I settled my
Kitmagar's account, and paid a few rupees to <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>each of the servants.
Mrs. F&mdash;&mdash; was taking in stores all day, in case of a siege.
The explosion was expected this day, as it was a failure yesterday. In
the evening I paid another visit to the ladies in the Begum's house.</p>

<p>Friday, June 12th. Captain W&mdash;&mdash; came over, and said the
Sepoys were to be sent to their homes and the officers from Cantonments
to come down here; this was good news indeed. Mr. G&mdash;&mdash; sent
over to say that a messenger was going off to Benares in disguise and
would take a small letter for each of us and try and post them there,
as our last overlands were still lying at the post-office, the road
having been closed for some days. We all commenced writing immediately,
one sheet each, and when they were sent over, Mr. G&mdash;&mdash;, to
our great disgust, said they were all too large, and that we could
only send a piece one quarter of the size; so we commenced again,
and the puzzle then was how to fold so small a piece for overland
passage. Soon after, while arranging with my servants and taking my
Kitmagar's account for May, I heard two muskets fired and some of
the great guns gallop off. I could hardly sit still, but I did not
like the men to see me frightened. I finished the Kitmagar's account
and paid it, but I must own he might have cheated me. When I went
back into the drawing-room I found it was the police had mutinied.
Soon after, the gentlemen came home and said the police had bolted,
but two guns and a company of Europeans <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>had gone after them;
also a body of gentlemen on horseback. In the evening I went over to
see Mrs. A&mdash;&mdash;, who was up for the first time. On my return,
we had tea and ices in the garden, and while sitting there the guns
and infantry returned bringing news that forty of the enemy had been
killed and many taken prisoners. Three of the Europeans had fallen out
by the way from the intense heat, and one had died from apoplexy. Two
of our Sikhs were killed; and Mr. T&mdash;&mdash;, a civilian, had
been wounded by a bayonet in his shoulder; he walked in while we were
there, and Dr. F&mdash;&mdash; took him into his room and dressed the
wound. We all retired for the night. Mr. E&mdash;&mdash;, 32nd Queen's,
came in for a moment in passing, but appeared quite done up; he threw
himself into a chair, and had a glass of soda-water, and told us that
they and the guns had not been able to get up with the enemy; he told
us, afterwards, he had been obliged to have leeches on his temples that
same night.</p>

<p>Saturday, June 13th. Rose early, and wrote to Charlie I expected my
piano up from Cantonments, as Mrs. F&mdash;&mdash; had offered to take
it in. About 7, I went in to dress and bathe, and while there Captain
W&mdash;&mdash; called and sent to say he must see me&mdash;no one
else could give me his message&mdash;he must see me himself. I quickly
dressed and threw on a shawl and received him <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>in Mrs. F&mdash;&mdash;'s
little room; it was to tell me that Charlie would be down at half-past
4, as the regiment was coming, but I was to say nothing about it till
they arrived. After that, they brought me news that my piano was
not allowed to pass the gate. I wrote Captain G&mdash;&mdash;, who
refused to let it pass, and then to Major A&mdash;&mdash;, who said
it was a peremptory order that no furniture could be taken into the
entrenchments, but he very kindly offered to take it into his own house
for me in the Teree Kotie, just outside; I, however, sent it to the
Martinière. The day passed quietly, and about 6 came dear Charlie;
he could not stay long, for he had engaged to dine with Sir Henry:
however, he first sent off the buggy and two great boxes of property,
which he had had brought up from Cantonments to the Martinière.</p>

<p>Sunday, June 14th. I rose early to see Charlie, and then went to
church at 7. The day was quiet, but word was brought that Captain
B&mdash;&mdash; and Mr. F&mdash;&mdash; of the 48th N.I., and Captain
S&mdash;&mdash;, and Mr. B&mdash;&mdash; of the 7th Cavalry, all out on
detachment duty, had been murdered by their men. Charlie came again in
the evening, and I had a nice chat with him.</p>

<p>Monday, June 15th. Charlie came again, and promised another visit
in the evening. My Ayah also came, and seemed overjoyed to see me; it
was agreed that she and her family should have a house in the bazaar:
the only drawback was, that now something must be done with <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>the
poor doggies, and they were under their charge. Poor Prince had such a
sore back from the heat, living in the tents with Charlie, that Charlie
had bought strychnine to give them before he came away, but had not
the heart to do it. At 11, in came Charlie, unexpectedly, to say he
had been ordered off to the Muchee Bawun with his Sikhs. I was greatly
disappointed, hoping to have had him here. It was agreed that the poor
pets were to be sent to him to the Muchee Bawun to be killed. I felt so
wretched all day, and the heat was intense&mdash;all was quiet.</p>

<p>Tuesday, June 16th. The first news we heard was, that Major
G&mdash;&mdash;, who had gone off in disguise with despatches, had been
betrayed by his men&mdash;ten of his own selecting&mdash;and killed at
Roy Bareilly; and while we were at breakfast, Captain W&mdash;&mdash;
brought news that a letter had come by a messenger from General
W&mdash;&mdash; at Cawnpore, dated the 14th, 11 o'clock. They had
held out till then, but had lost a great number of men&mdash;Captain
W&mdash;&mdash; would not say how many&mdash;so I fear it was very bad
news. The Ayah came, and the poor doggies were taken to Charlie. I had
not the heart to take a last look at them. Charlie and the cook drowned
them in the river. Poor Charlie! it was hard for him to have to do it.
The day passed quietly, but bad news was arriving from the district
constantly. Mrs. B&mdash;&mdash; and some others killed at Sultanpore.
She in a Rajah's fort!&mdash;but one hears <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>now of nothing but
wholesale massacres! Charlie came in the evening, and it did my heart
good to see him.</p>

<p>Wednesday, June 17th. We heard to-day of Mr. C&mdash;&mdash;, the
civilian, being killed; he was engaged to Miss D&mdash;&mdash;; her
wedding things had arrived just before these troublous times, and
the marriage had been postponed. We heard that Mr. B&mdash;&mdash;,
of the 48th, had been shot in the trenches at Cawnpore; his servant
brought in the news. News was also brought that the Futteyghur people,
160 in number, had been murdered on the parade ground at Cawnpore, in
sight of our people. They were going down the river in boats, but were
stopped and taken to Cawnpore and there blown from guns. The day was
quiet here. They are building a wall up against our windows to keep
off musket shots; it is loop-holed, also, for our troops in case of
necessity. The Fyzabad Rajah has joined the rebels, and is said to be
very near us with his guns. Charlie came early in the evening.</p>

<p>Thursday, June 18th. I paid my bearer his account, and he went off
to be with Charlie. Major B&mdash;&mdash; came in several times. All
garrison officers were ordered to their posts this morning, to receive
orders what they are to do when the enemy arrives. The Martinière boys
were brought in. Just before breakfast, the groom brought me seven
rupees, saying he had sold the <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39"
id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>poor buggy horse. I felt much inclined
for a good cry; I have driven him myself so often. We were obliged to
sell him. Charlie came about half-past 6; one of his Sikhs had taken
an immense quantity of churrus, and become quite frenzied, and then
stabbed another Sikh; they called on him to put down his arms, or he
would be shot, and he threw down his musket with such force that he
broke it in pieces; the other poor man died.</p>

<p>Friday, June 19th. A quiet day. Charlie could not come to see me,
as he was on duty at one of the gates of the Muchee Bawun; there are
five gates, and four officers to each gate. Charlie takes it morning
and evening, while the others are at gun drill. All, nearly, are
obliged to learn the gun drill from some Artillery Sergeant, to be
ready if wanted. Our entrenchments, they say, are now very strong; we
have several mortars, and two 18-pounders are placed at the entrance
to the Cawnpore road. A reconnoitering party went out, and returned
in the evening, saying there was not an enemy to be seen for miles
round. This evening there was a fire seen in Cantonments, but it was
accidental; however, they got an alarm in the night, as several Sowars
were seen riding about; they also had an alarm at the Muchee Bawun.
Captain C&mdash;&mdash; woke them up and said a party of the enemy
were coming, but it ended in nothing.</p> <p><span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p> <p>Saturday, June
20th. Charlie came about half-past 7, and stayed nearly an hour. After
breakfast Dr. P&mdash;&mdash; read "Guy Mannering" to us while we
worked. I cut out and made a flannel shirt for Charlie, as I could
get no durzie. We are forbidden now to go over to the Residency or
the Begum Kotee, as there is <a id="corr8"></a>small-pox in both. In the former Mrs.
B&mdash;&mdash; has it, and one of Mrs. B&mdash;&mdash;'s children.
Mrs. B&mdash;&mdash; is removed into a tent, in all this heat! To-day a
letter came from General W&mdash;&mdash; at Cawnpore, saying they still
held out, but had provisions and ammunition for only one fortnight
longer; that no reinforcements had reached them, but that their
greatest enemy was the sun: more had died from sunstroke than had been
killed by the enemy, and that their greatest consolation was that they
were keeping the enemy from us. It is most distressing that we cannot
send them any troops; but if even we could spare them, they could never
get across the river at Cawnpore, for the enemy have both sides of it;
firing, both musketry and artillery, was heard all day in the district.
The landowners are fighting amongst themselves, to get back what was
taken from them at the annexation. A fire was seen burning in the
district all night.</p>

<p>Sunday, June 21st. Rose at daybreak as usual, and went into the
garden for a breath of air; the heat at night is fearful. Charlie came
in at half-past 7; he is looking better, he is not so exposed <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>at the
Muchee Bawun as he would be here; still, he has never taken off his
clothes at night since he went on guard the week I left Cantonments;
he is always sleeping at some gate or other: but he looks better than
could be expected, and says his appetite has returned. We had service
in the drawing-room&mdash;Mr. H&mdash;&mdash; performed it&mdash;for
the church is filled with stores. In the evening, service was performed
in Mr. G&mdash;&mdash;'s garden, the two Padres reading and preaching
under a tree; but the heat was so great I could not go. In the night we
had the first fall of rain, and welcomed it accordingly.</p>

<p>Monday, June 22nd. Rose at daybreak and took the air in the
verandah, as it was raining. However, it cleared in time for Charlie to
pay me his visit. The day passed without a word of news, or any alarm.
Dr. P&mdash;&mdash; went on with "Guy Mannering," and I worked at
Charlie's flannel shirt. Miss N&mdash;&mdash; came over in the evening
and said Sir M&mdash;&mdash; J&mdash;&mdash; and his two sisters were
hourly expected. I had a note from Mrs. R&mdash;&mdash;, at the Begum
Kotee; her baby is very ill with dysentery, and she said the room was
so filled with ladies and children with fever that when the poor little
thing wanted to sleep it could not. She ended the note by saying she
felt her child's illness and her anxiety for her husband's safety were
almost too much for her.</p>

<p>Tuesday, June 23rd. Charlie came as usual; he <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>has
been present at two hangings: the day passed without news, either good
or bad.</p>

<p>Wednesday, June 24th. Charlie came late; I was quite proud to show
him his flannel shirt, and sent it for him to try on. I went down with
Mrs. F&mdash;&mdash; to her go-down (store-room) and saw all her stores
in case of a siege&mdash;rice and flour&mdash;all in large earthen
jars, that reminded one of the jars the forty thieves were put into, in
"Ali Baba." Certain news reached us to-day that the enemy are closing
round us; there are eight regiments with six guns at Nawab-Gunge,
twenty miles from here; it is said they intend coming here, and
encamping in the Dil Koosha.</p>

<p>Thursday, June 25th. Another day without a word of news, good or
bad; even gentlemen begin to croak.</p>

<p>Friday, June 26th. The first news in the morning was good. Mrs.
B&mdash;&mdash; heard of the safety of her husband. I went in, as
usual, at 7, to take my bath, that I might be ready for Charlie;
and Miss S&mdash;&mdash; came running in with the good news, sent
by Sir H. Lawrence, that Delhi had fallen on the 13th&mdash;that
Futteyghur, Mynpoorie, and Etawah were quiet&mdash;the telegraph open
to Delhi&mdash;and the dawk to within twenty miles of Cawnpore.<a
name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6"
class="fnanchor">[6]</a> Glorious news! a salute was fired. Charlie
came, but would not stay; he <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43"
id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>wanted to take back the news to the
Muchee Bawun, and have the salute fired before ours. We cannot be too
thankful! the insurgents at the best, are cowards; and this news will
quite quell all spirit in them. Charlie had been to gun-drill&mdash;all
in the garrison have to learn it. The rest of the day passed as
usual, Dr. P&mdash;&mdash; reading to us till 4 o'clock dinner;
after that I generally lie down till 6 and then take the air in the
Compound&mdash;at 8 they generally bring tea and ices, and then Mr.
H&mdash;&mdash; reads prayers and we all go to our rooms.</p>

<p>Saturday, June 27th. It was little Bobby F&mdash;&mdash;'s birthday;
he was one year old. Charlie came at a quarter to 8, and told us Capt.
H&mdash;&mdash;'s murderer had been captured at Allyghur; also that it
was reported the 12th N.I. had mutinied at Jhansi, and killed every
one of their officers; a letter came from Col. W&mdash;&mdash;, at
Cawnpore, with a list of the killed&mdash;about half their number;
he said that their sufferings had surpassed anything ever written in
history, and that their greatest enemy had been the sun; many ladies
and children had died from it: but now they had dug underground places
and put the women and children in. Brigadier Jack and his brother had
both died from sunstrokes. In the course of the day came a pencilled
letter from a Mr. M&mdash;&mdash; at Cawnpore, to his father, Col.
M&mdash;&mdash;, here, saying that they were treating with the enemy;
this threw us all into consternation, for we <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>thought General
W&mdash;&mdash; would have stood out to the last; however, it is said
to be the Rajah of Bhitoor (the Nana), who has commenced the treating
with them. A lac of rupees has been set on his head, if brought in
within a week. I suppose he had heard of this and became frightened,
for he offered General W&mdash;&mdash; to conduct them all down to
Allahabad safely, if they would lay down their arms and give him
a lac of rupees. This Rajah is a Mahratta, a notedly treacherous
race, so that we were very glad to hear firing had commenced
again at Cawnpore;<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a
href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> proof that, of course,
Gen. Wheeler would not agree to such a treaty.</p>

<p>Sunday, June 28th. The rain had been pouring down all night, the
first regular rain we had had; there had been nothing but a storm
before, and now I was rather disappointed at its coming, for Charlie
had agreed to come at half-past 5 and take me to Mr. I&mdash;&mdash;s'
house to get some things out of a wardrobe we have placed there,
and he was to be back in time for service at 7 at the Muchee Bawun;
however, he could not come, and we could not go to service here in
the mess-house on account of the rain. About 2 we got a slight alarm,
hearing that two guns, some Europeans, 13th Sepoys, and 71st Sikhs, had
been ordered off somewhere; however, it turned out that they had <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>been
sent to the King's palace for all the jewels. Two Nawabs were sent
with them (I forgot to say we have five Nawabs prisoners in the Muchee
Bawun), and they were made to understand that if there were the least
disturbance they would be shot. Some fighting was expected, as there
were armed men in the palace. Charlie came about 3, and stayed an hour.
About 6, as we were going to church, we saw all the party returning,
the carts filled with great boxes, and the golden throne, said to be
worth a <a id="corr18"></a>crore of rupees! Captain W&mdash;&mdash;
told me some of the crowns were most elegant, the designs really
beautiful, and also some of the necklaces, in one of which the diamonds
are set in rays; one crown is silver set with amethysts. The King kept
his own European jeweller, a man from H&mdash;&mdash;'s in Calcutta.
We set off walking to church, which was held in the Thug hospital
belonging to the Thug goal; it is now the mess-house for all the
infantry and cavalry officers. We had to enter by innumerable little
arches of curious architecture, and up and down lots of steps and
through two quadrangles, and then came in front of what appeared to be
a Musjid,&mdash;the whole side open with beautiful arches,&mdash;they
had begun service; rows of chairs had been placed for the congregation
on either side of the mess-tables; the reading desk had been brought
from the church. All round appeared to be little dark rooms, in which
the officer's beds had been placed; also the <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>large platform outside was
filled with chairs, and beds were standing about in all directions.
It was a most extraordinary scene; there was an immense congregation,
and the whole place was filled with ladies and gentlemen. Mr.
P&mdash;&mdash; read prayers, and Mr. H&mdash;&mdash; preached; the
poor people at Cawnpore were prayed for; also Dr. S&mdash;&mdash; of
the 32nd, who is very ill; and all in hospital, sick and wounded: and
then those who had lost relations in these frightful massacres. It
was a most imposing service, and one could not but feel thankful for
having been so mercifully preserved. Some officers came in late, all
booted and spurred,&mdash;I fancy from the party that had just brought
in the jewels. We had a thunderstorm during service, and at the end
were rather alarmed at hearing three guns fired, but it must have been
in the district; they are fighting and quarrelling amongst themselves.
It rained when we came out of church, and was very dark, so I and Miss
S&mdash;&mdash; stumbled on the best way we could over the steps and
uneven ground, hardly knowing which way to take; it was such a novelty
walking to church in India, and especially under an umbrella. Soon
after our return it poured down famously; we had tea and ices, and then
Mr. H&mdash;&mdash; read prayers, and we retired for the night.</p>

<p>Monday, June 29th. Sir H. Lawrence and his Staff came while
we were sitting in the garden, <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>to take a survey of Dr.
F&mdash;&mdash;'s defences. Charlie came at 7, and I went with him to
Mr. I&mdash;&mdash;s' house, to my wardrobe. I could not recognise it
for our old guard-house, where I had been so frequently with Charlie
on city duty. All the buildings are thrown down round it; it is in the
outer entrenchment. The Compound was filled with tents with Crannies
and their wives; the day passed without alarm.</p>

<p>Tuesday, June 30th. I rose early, and found Dr.&mdash;&mdash; all
booted and spurred for service. I then heard a detachment had been
ordered off to meet the enemy, who were five miles off. Three hundred
Europeans, nine guns, and an 8-inch howitzer, and 150 of the 13th N.I.,
&amp;c., went out. I sat, as usual, in the garden, till 7, and then
went in to bathe and dress, and be ready for Charlie. However, to my
surprise, he never came, and I sent off a note to the Muchee Bawun
asking the reason. While the servant was gone with it, some came flying
back saying our troops had been surrounded by the mutineers, who were
in great numbers, and that several of our officers had been killed.
Just then, to my horror, came back the note I had sent with a message
from Captain F&mdash;&mdash; that my husband had gone out with the
detachment. I never shall forget that dreadful suspense as the news
was brought in that Col. C&mdash;&mdash;, Capt. S&mdash;&mdash;, Mr.
T&mdash;&mdash;, and Mr. B&mdash;&mdash;, of the 32nd were killed. The
latter had always paid us a visit, mornings <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>and evenings. At last
came Dr. P&mdash;&mdash;, saying they were sorely pressed by the enemy,
but that he had seen my husband all right. Soon after came a Sepoy,
sent by Charlie himself, to say he was all safe; and immediately after
a 13th Sepoy, of his own accord, came to tell me he had seen Charlie
coming in on a gun as he was very faint, and that Major B&mdash;&mdash;
was wounded. I was frightened, thinking Charlie had got a sunstroke.
He told me, afterwards, he had had a most narrow escape, as he was far
back in the retreat. It had proved far different to the expectations of
the morning, for the Native Artillerymen had proved faithless; and, the
enemy being in far greater numbers than our spies had led us to expect,
our little party was almost surrounded, and it was only a wonder any
escaped to tell the tale. The sun also was so overpowering that many
fell down from sheer faintness, without a wound, and were cut to pieces
by the enemy, for few had any horses to return with. The officers had
dismounted to fall in with their men, and the horses disappeared;
either the enemy or the servants made away with them,&mdash;poor
Charlie's dear old charger amongst the rest; the poor horse that was
shot in the nose the night of the mutiny. It was a fearful morning,
never to be forgotten, this affair of Chinhut! Another providential
escape for dear Charlie, for which we cannot be sufficiently thankful!
The siege now commenced, the enemy began firing on us as they
followed the retreating <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49"
id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>party. Our gates were closed, we got a
cup of tea and something for breakfast as best we could, sitting behind
the walls to escape the balls; not that I fancy any of us had very much
appetite. At last the balls came so thick that we were all ordered
down into the Tye Khana (underground room), and kept there. Towards
evening the firing slackened a little, and we sat in the portico to get
a little air. There were twenty-four of us in the house&mdash;eleven
ladies, six gentlemen and seven children. Captain W&mdash;&mdash; was
the commandant of our garrison, which consisted of an officer and
some twenty of the 32nd Queen's, with some Native Pensioners, and a
mixed party of men to work the 18 and 9-pounder guns in the garden. At
night we purposed sleeping in our own rooms, but Dr. F&mdash;&mdash;
considered it not safe to do so; we therefore all stretched our bedding
on the floor of the Tye Khana, putting the children in the centre for
the benefit of the punkah. We took it by turns to watch for an hour.</p>

<p>Wednesday, July 1st.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a
href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> We just managed to get to
our rooms and dress, when the firing got very sharp&mdash;round shot
and shell; already we began to distinguish the different sounds as
they whizzed past: in the afternoon the enemy got into a building very
near and fired away at us till evening, when they slackened again. I
got a note <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a>
</span>from dear Charlie, saying he was all right again I felt
so thankful. Shortly after came Capt. W&mdash;&mdash;, to whom I read
it; he begged me to copy it for Sir Henry as there was more news in
it than in any that had been received from the Muchee Bawun; he also
said they had paid 100 rupees for getting one carried there. I copied
it, and he told me that I should soon see Charlie; and we heard the
garrison of the Muchee Bawun had been ordered to come in that night at
half-past 12, evacuating the fort as silently as possible, and blowing
it up. We all expected they would have to fight every inch of the way
in, and were in great anxiety in consequence; however, we went to bed,
and I even slept, when about half-past 12 we were awoke by the most
horrible explosion. It shattered every bit of glass in the house!
There were four doors to our Tye Khana, half glass, and the concussion
covered us with the glass, and shook one of the doors off its hinges.
I believe all of us thought our last hour was come; each started up
with a kind of groan, for we had been expecting the enemy were mining,
as we had fancied we had each night heard strokes of a pickaxe, about
half a dozen at a time, and then a stoppage as if they feared to make
too much noise: the gentlemen had been down to listen and heard it
distinctly, so that when the explosion came, I certainly expected to
go up into the air; and the inexpressible <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>relief it was to hear
Dr. F&mdash;&mdash;, at the head of the stairs, calling out "It is all
right! The whole party are in safe, and the Muchee Bawun blown up!" No
wonder the explosion was so terrific, there were upwards of 20,000 lbs.
of powder, besides a vast quantity of musket ammunition!</p>

<p>Thursday, July 2nd. The attack on the Bailey Guard Gate and our
Compound was tremendous, and while we were at breakfast we were all
inexpressibly shocked and grieved to hear poor Sir Henry had been
mortally wounded; a shell from the very 8-inch howitzer the enemy had
taken from us at Chinhut, had burst in his room in the Residency, and
given him a fearful wound in his hip! He was brought over into our
verandah, and Mr. H&mdash;&mdash; administered the Sacrament to him.
Sir Henry then sent for several whom he fancied he had spoken harshly
to in their duty, and begged their forgiveness, and many shed tears to
think the good old man would so soon be taken from us. Our only earthly
hope in this crisis! Sir Henry then appointed <a id="corr19"></a>Major
B&mdash;&mdash; his successor. The firing was fearful; the enemy must
have discovered from some spies that Sir Henry was at our house, for
the attack on the gate was fearful. We all gave ourselves up for lost,
for we did not then know the cowards they were, and we expected every
moment they would be over our garden wall; there was no escape for
us, if they were once in the garden! We <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>asked Mr. H&mdash;&mdash;
to read prayers, and I believe every one of us prepared for the worst;
the shots were now coming so thick into the verandah where Sir Henry
was lying, that several officers were wounded, and he was obliged to
be removed into the drawing-room. We gave out an immense quantity of
rag to the poor soldiers, <a id="corr20"></a>as they passed up and
down from the roof of the house wounded. Towards evening the fire
slackened, but we were not allowed to leave the Tye Khana. At night Mr.
H&mdash;&mdash; came and read prayers again, and then we (ladies and
children) lay down on the floor without undressing.</p>

<p>Friday, July 3rd. When we awoke we found all the servants had
deserted excepting my Kitmagar and Mrs. B&mdash;&mdash;'s, and one
or two Ayahs. The F&mdash;&mdash;'s had not one servant left, so
we were obliged to get up and act as servants ourselves, and do <a
id="corr1"></a>everything, excepting the cooking, even to washing
plates and dishes; and perhaps it was a good thing, for it kept us from
dwelling on our misery. Dear Charlie came to see me in the afternoon,
and brought a jug of milk for the poor children. I was glad to hear
he had had a good luncheon, for the day before when he came he said
he had had nothing for some days but dal (peas) and rice; we happened
to be at dinner, and I gave him a piece of meat, but he seemed too
much done up to eat it, and actually carried it away in a piece of
paper to some other gentleman who could get none. No arrangements
have been made for <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53"
id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>messing at present, and no one can tell
where to get anything.</p>

<p>Saturday, July 4th. Firing had been going on all night, and it
continued all day, but we were so engaged in kitchen duties we scarcely
noticed it. Poor Sir Henry died in the morning; he had been in great
agony from his wound! He was buried with the rest at night, but even
he did not have a separate grave; each corpse is sewn up in its own
bedding, and those who have died during the day are put into the same
grave at night.</p>

<p>Sunday, July 5th. The firing was incessant, and after breakfast
Mr. H&mdash;&mdash; arranged all our duties, for up to this time they
had been rather unequally performed; after that we had service in
the Tye Khana, and the Holy Sacrament was administered. I so wished
dear Charlie could have been present, it seemed so solemn and yet so
comforting while the firing was going on around us!&mdash;nothing else
occurred worth noting.</p>

<p>Monday, July 6th. The insurgents filled J&mdash;&mdash;s' house, and
kept firing into our Compound; we fired a number of shrapnell into the
house, without dislodging them. We fancied they must be getting short
of ammunition, for they fired all sorts of strange missiles&mdash;such
as nails, pieces of ramrod, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Tuesday, July 7th. Charlie came, after breakfast, and told me that
a sortie was to be made <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54"
id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>into J&mdash;&mdash;s' house; this
was done between 1 and 2 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span>&mdash;two
officers and some men of the 32nd and Mr. G&mdash;&mdash; and some of
our Sikhs&mdash;a hole was made through the wall of the Brigade Mess,
opposite J&mdash;&mdash;s' house, an 18-pounder firing down our lane
all the time to distract the enemy's attention. A rush was then made,
and every Native in the house killed&mdash;numbering some thirty or
forty. In the afternoon we had the first really heavy fall of rain, and
the enemy's fire slackened in consequence. Poor Captain F&mdash;&mdash;
this night had one leg taken off, and the other shattered, by a
round shot, while sitting on the roof of the Brigade Mess! Mr.
H&mdash;&mdash; saw him after the amputation had taken place, and said
he was very composed. Mr. O&mdash;&mdash; died from his wound received
at the Redan battery.</p>

<p>Wednesday, July 8th. Poor Mr. P&mdash;&mdash; was hit in the body
by a musket shot; fortunately, the ball made a circuit round the body,
instead of touching any vital part: he received the wound in the
hospital. The firing was very sharp. I felt quite knocked up, after my
morning duties. Charlie came, after dinner, and sat about an hour; he
then went over to the hospital to see poor Captain F&mdash;&mdash;. He
found him insensible and very restless, and the doctors said he was
not going on well; about 9 o'clock he died. <a id="corr21"></a>He and
Mr. O&mdash;&mdash;, and two others, were buried in the same grave;
the funerals are always at <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55"
id="Page_55">[55]</a> </span>night, as the fire then slackens a little.
Sometimes, Mr. P&mdash;&mdash; and Mr. H&mdash;&mdash; have had to dig
the graves themselves! Soon after we lay down for the night, we were
aroused by an alarm; it was false, and had been caused by a soldier
dreaming: but, towards the morning, we were alarmed again by the enemy
making an attack on our gate. We all got up and prepared, in case we
had to run to the Begum Kotee, for there had been a hole dug in the
wall opposite one of our doors for us to escape by in case the enemy
should pass the gate.</p>

<p>Thursday, July 9th. I rose and made the early tea for the whole
party as Mrs. A&mdash;&mdash; was ill, and while engaged in it an order
came down for bottles of hot water, Mr. D&mdash;&mdash; being taken
with cholera; after breakfast he appeared better, but it did not last.
About noon Mr. H&mdash;&mdash; administered the Sacrament to him, and
at 1 o'clock he died. Mrs. D&mdash;&mdash; seemed wonderfully calm.
After making tea in the evening I went and lay down on my bedding in
the Tye Khana, feeling tired out, and fell so fast asleep, that they
all came down and had prayers without my knowing anything about it.</p>

<p>Friday, July 10th. We were ordered to sit upstairs as much
as possible, as the Tye Khana and <a id="corr9"></a>Go-downs were considered
unhealthy; fortunately, the firing was so slack, that we could
sit at the front door. It was quite delightful to have a little
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
cessation from the constant noise. Mrs. D&mdash;&mdash;
joined us, and seemed quite calm and cheerful. Charlie brought over six
bottles of mustard, as we had very little and it was in great demand
in cases of cholera; in the afternoon he came and chatted with me. Mr.
H&mdash;&mdash; had only one funeral this evening.</p>

<p>Saturday, July 11th. There had been an alarm in the night, but I
had heard nothing of it. I rose and made the early tea; and while
carrying a cup to Mrs. F&mdash;&mdash;, slipped down some steps and
sprained my ancle: it became so painful that Dr. P&mdash;&mdash;
recommended my fomenting it with hot water, and laying it up&mdash;so
I was unfortunately <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">hors de combat</i>. Charlie sold poor Capt.
F&mdash;&mdash;s' property, and made 500 rupees of a box of second-hand
clothes, such a great demand was there for them; he afterwards brought
me a box of his papers and rings, which I locked up for his poor
sister, in case I should ever be able to give it to her. Very slack
firing all day; the enemy occasionally fired pieces of wood shaped
liked nine-pins, and bound with iron. There was a report that the Nana
was this day coming to join the rebels. There were five funerals this
evening.</p>

<p>Sunday, July 12th. We had slept in the dining-room for the first
time&mdash;but the mosquitoes were fearful&mdash;as the punkah was
too heavy to be of any good. About half-past 10, Charlie came <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>and
stayed to prayers; at 12 Dr. F&mdash;&mdash; made us all again dine in
the Tye Khana, as the dinner upstairs brought such swarms of flies. In
the evening the ladies sat under the portico and sang very prettily;
Capt. W&mdash;&mdash; joining them just as they had sung one verse of
the evening hymn: the enemy commenced firing so sharply that there was
a call to arms, and the gentlemen all rushed off to their posts. The
attack was first on Mr. G&mdash;&mdash;s' house, and then came round
to <a id="corr12"></a>ours; we went to bed, but the firing was so loud
and the mosquitoes so lively that we slept but little; in fact, we all
wished ourselves down in the Tye Khana again.</p>

<p>Monday, July 13th. Rose, feeling wretched. My face is becoming
covered with boils, but <a id="corr2"></a>hardly any one is without
them now. The firing still very sharp; a European soldier was wounded
in the corner of our verandah. The enemy were said to be again in
J&mdash;&mdash;s' house; a Native was shot dead, coming from the Begum
Kotee to our kitchen: altogether, eight were hit in our Compound during
the day. Charlie could not come till the evening, and then stayed only
a few minutes. Mrs. T&mdash;&mdash; very ill, with the small-pox, at
the Begum Kotee.</p>

<p>Tuesday, July 14th. Dear J&mdash;&mdash;'s birthday. I had slept
soundly, though the firing had <a id="corr3"></a>been very sharp
all night. The 17th N.I. were seen with their colours amongst
the rebels; there were all kinds of reports of relief&mdash;none
true! Charlie <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58"
id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>came over about dinner time, and sat some
time, but I could not offer him any: I drank J&mdash;&mdash;'s health
in sherry. An attack was expected at night, and all preparations were
made; we ladies were sent down to the Tye Khana to sleep. The rebels
had placed an 18-pounder in position for our house; however, the
ammunition for the gun was blown up, and we passed a quiet night, with
the exception of a skirmish with the punkah coolies.</p>

<p>Wednesday, July 15th. Charlie came soon after breakfast, and told me
the narrow escape he had had, from the careless firing of a 9-pounder
by a sergeant who had been instructed by an artillery officer to
fire shrapnell into J&mdash;&mdash;s' house; he fired one into Capt.
C&mdash;&mdash;'s quarters, which Charlie had only a minute before
vacated; he had been dressing on the very spot where the shrapnell
burst. There was very little firing during the day, but Lieut.
L&mdash;&mdash; was shot on the roof of Mr. G&mdash;&mdash;s' house;
Capt. F&mdash;&mdash; came for Dr. F&mdash;&mdash;; they could not find
the ball, but fancied it had touched the spine, as all the lower part
of the body was paralysed. Our party sat in the verandah, singing songs
and glees. It made me feel quite melancholy, for the round shots were
whizzing overhead, and no one could tell but that the next might bring
death with it!</p>

<p>Thursday, July 16th. We heard that our troops had had a fight with
the insurgents at Futtehpore, who had come from Cawnpore to meet
them, and <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a>
</span>that we had taken four guns. No one knows if this be
true, but it is possible, and that our troops are waiting there for
reinforcements. Mrs. T&mdash;&mdash; died of small-pox. The heat and
flies were dreadful; in the evening Mr. H&mdash;&mdash; had five
funerals, one, poor Mrs. T&mdash;&mdash;. He said he had had a most
narrow escape; going to the churchyard, a shot struck the ground
directly between the two dhoolies carried in front of him, and covered
them with earth! That night I rebelled against watching; we had had
quite a fight about it during the day.</p>

<p>Friday, July 17th. The enemy had an 18-pounder in position to fire
on an angle of our house. Mrs. S&mdash;&mdash;'s eldest child died of
cholera. Dear Charlie paid me his daily visit. The firing was rather
slack; the heat during the day was so intense, that the soldiers were
allowed to lie down in the drawing-room. Mr. H&mdash;&mdash; had three
funerals this night;&mdash;Lieut. A&mdash;&mdash;, of the Artillery and
Captain B&mdash;&mdash;, were both wounded by a mortar that the former
was superintending the loading of. Lieut. B&mdash;&mdash;, Artillery,
was wounded yesterday. About 11 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span> we were
aroused by a very sharp firing,&mdash;an attempt made again at the
Bailey Guard Gate, but was unsuccessful; still I got up and prepared
for a rush to the top of the house, as they say that is our safest
place if the enemy get in; the gentlemen can defend us up there.</p>

<p>Saturday, July 18th. I will write exactly my <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
employment this day to show how each day is passed. I arose a
little before 6, and made tea for all the party; then, with
Mrs. A&mdash;&mdash;'s assistance, gave out the rations for the
day&mdash;ottah, rice, sugar, sago, arrowroot, &amp;c., &amp;c.
While doing this a 6-pound shot came through the verandah above,
broke down some plaster and bricks, and fell at our feet; Mrs.
B&mdash;&mdash; and some children had a very narrow escape; they
were sitting in the verandah at the time, but no one was hurt. I
then rushed at the Bheestie (the water-carrier), who was passing,
and made him fill a tin can with water for me, which I forthwith
"lugged" upstairs and bathed and dressed; it was about half-past 8
when I was ready, so I went to the front door to get a breath of air;
at 9 down again to make tea for the breakfast, which consisted of a
small piece of roast mutton, chupattees, rice, and jam. I then worked
on some of Charlie's garments till nearly dinner time&mdash;4 <span
class="smcap">P.M.</span>&mdash;when I felt very poorly, but it passed
off.</p>

<p>Sunday, July 19th. The firing was very sharp; there had been an
attack during the night. Early in the morning two round shots came
into the long room through the drawing-room, and yesterday while the
ladies were sitting in the long room a 9-pound shot came in through
the drawing-room and slanted through a side door&mdash;breaking down
the door-post and covering several of them with dust. Charlie came in,
in time for prayers, which <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61"
id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>Mr. H&mdash;&mdash; read at 12 in the
entrance hall; we had been kept down in the Tye Khana till then:
by dinner time I became very ill. Charlie had given me a piece of
ration biscuit, so I had that with a glass of port wine, instead of
dinner. This afternoon an 18-pounder came into the drawing-room;
we were all sent down to the Tye Khana in a great hurry. It was
after dinner this day that Captain W&mdash;&mdash; gave us the
particulars of the Cawnpore massacre. He said it was Thursday, June
25th, when they began to treat; the Nana required that they should
leave everything&mdash;arms, ammunition, &amp;c.&mdash;and he would
provide them boats; some lady in a dhoolie was carried over to the
Nana&mdash;it is thought to have been Lady W&mdash;&mdash;. On Friday
lots of hackeries were sent down to the entrenchments to convey the
party to the boats, but were returned, and on Saturday a lot of
elephants were sent instead and the party mounted them; the sick, and
ladies who could not travel this way, were sent in dhoolies, and the
whole party was escorted by the Nana's force to a Ghaut about a mile
from the entrenchments, where the boats were waiting. However, it
was discovered that there were neither cars nor ropes to the boats,
or boatmen; nevertheless, they were told to get in and drop down the
stream; and two boats filled and got ahead of the others: the remaining
eight were loading when a battery, masked behind some trees, opened
fire on them, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
and the Sepoys rushed down and bayonetted the women
and children&mdash;selecting fifteen or eighteen of the young ladies
and taking them off to their camp! The two boats that had gone ahead
were first fired into from the opposite bank of the river and sunk.
At this juncture, they say, some of the 56th N.I. rushed to their
rescue and a few escaped. I had been so ill in the morning that I
had been obliged to have Dr. F&mdash;&mdash; to attend me,&mdash;and
I was better towards evening, when the pain came on so violently I
fancied I had cholera coming on. Dr. F&mdash;&mdash; gave me another
dose of opium, but I was very ill all night and fainted away; they
called Dr. F&mdash;&mdash; to me, and he dosed me again and ordered
a mustard poultice, I went up and lay down in Mrs. H&mdash;&mdash;'s
room&mdash;the only safe one upstairs.</p>

<p>Monday, July 20th. Towards morning the round shot began flying
about thickly&mdash;two 18-pounders came into Mr. H&mdash;&mdash;'s
room while he was dressing; they came in high, and covered him with
a cloud of dust: the bricks and mortar fell thick around him, but
he escaped unhurt. Soon the attack became tremendous all around us:
round shot flying in all directions; musketry on the roof of our house
incessant. Strange to say, I never winced or closed my ears; however,
I and Miss S&mdash;&mdash;, who was kindly fanning me, decided we
had better go down to the Tye Khana. Breakfast, however, all were
too much engaged to come <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63"
id="Page_63">[63]</a></span> to. The attack lasted more than four
hours; and they say, at the least, we were surrounded by 4,000; six
of their guns were pointed at our house. About half-past 12, Dr.
F&mdash;&mdash; called down to us that it was all right; and one by
one the gentlemen came down to breakfast. They said the enemy had been
beaten back, with great slaughter: one 32nd Sergeant shot fourteen of
them, one had seen twenty killed here, another, thirty there. They
opened the attack this day by springing a mine at the Redan Battery,
but without harm to us. I continued very faint and weak throughout
the day. While dinner was going on, about 5 o'clock, Charlie came
over; I was so thankful to see him safe. One more providential escape
he has had, and I could not feel sufficiently thankful: a bullet had
entered his helmet at the side, gone out at the top, carrying the
ventilator with it! He and his Sikhs are in a large house&mdash;Mr.
O&mdash;&mdash;'s kutcherry&mdash;and in a very small verandah, that
they occupied during the attack, twenty-two round shots had come
in. Charlie said they had attacked with the spirit of Europeans.
Some Mussulmen Sowars, carrying a green standard, had tried to cross
the stockade, close to his post; the leaders of the party were all
killed, and the flag left in the brushwood. At this crisis a plucky
man rushed up, and although his right arm was broken by a musket
shot, he contrived to extricate it, and carry it off with his <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
left. After that, an attack was made at the same point, by Sepoys,
with muskets and bayonets, but also unsuccessfully. Another
account Charlie gave of Mr. L&mdash;&mdash;, commanding at our old
guard-house&mdash;now I&mdash;&mdash;s' post; they had the hardest
work to keep it. Mr. L&mdash;&mdash; considers, at that part alone,
100 of the enemy were killed; so that all agree their loss must have
been very great, whereas we had only two killed, and very few wounded:
amongst the latter, Mr. E&mdash;&mdash;, of the 32nd, at the Redan, and
Mr. H&mdash;&mdash;, 7th L.C. The 13th, at the Bailey Guard, behaved
splendidly. This day, Mr. P&mdash;&mdash; died of cholera; his wound
had been progressing nicely, when he was seized with cholera. Towards
night, the firing had almost ceased. Mrs. B&mdash;&mdash; fancied
her child had cholera, so we were kept awake the greater part of the
night.</p>

<p>Tuesday, July 21st. I rose early, feeling better; while sitting
at the door for air, Major B&mdash;&mdash; called in and chatted
with us. Charlie came at breakfast to see how I was, and again at 1
o'clock, bringing me a saucepan of soup and a bottle of port wine
to enable me to get up my strength again. Just after he left, the
enemy made an attack, principally on Mr. G&mdash;&mdash;s' house, and
word was brought that Major B&mdash;&mdash; had been shot through
the head on the roof of the house, and Dr. D&mdash;&mdash; wounded;
the times are awful!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65"
id="Page_65">[65]</a></span> Major B&mdash;&mdash; is, indeed, a loss;
a tremendous attack was expected at night, but it passed off quietly;
probably, on account of the heavy fall of rain we had. The siege has
lasted, now, more than three weeks.</p>

<p>Wednesday, July 22nd. I made the early tea and breakfast; hardly any
firing going on. Charlie came over and read some of my journal; after
he left, he sent me over a saucepan of soup, and one of his ration
biscuits. About 1 o'clock, Capt. E&mdash;&mdash; came running over from
the G&mdash;&mdash;s' for Dr. F&mdash;&mdash;, as Mrs. D&mdash;&mdash;
had been shot through the head as she was sitting in a bedroom just off
the G&mdash;&mdash;s' dining-room; her death was instantaneous. In the
evening Mr. H&mdash;&mdash; had nine funerals.</p>

<p>Thursday, July 23rd. The first news in the morning was, that a
Native Pensioner had come in from Cawnpore, with tidings that a large
body of Europeans were at Cawnpore, and that they had crossed ten guns;
they had had three fights with the Nana, and had burnt his house.
Every one believes this; and we may expect them by the first proximo.
It is glorious news, indeed! The Pensioner was sent off again, with a
letter, and only one rupee (as he himself requested); but, if he brings
an answer, he is to have 500 rupees, and a double pension for life.
The man's name was Ungud. I now have to wash my own clothes, and this
morning had a scrimmage for water,&mdash;Mrs. <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>H&mdash;&mdash;'s Ayah
having had the impertinence to run off with my can of water, after I
had had the trouble of bringing it upstairs. Firing, slack to-day; it
is supposed many of the enemy have gone to meet our reinforcements.
To-day, we spoilt the bridge of boats over the Goomtee, by firing round
shot at it. The night was quiet.</p>

<p>Friday, July 24th. A grand scrimmage about the goats and milk for
the children. The reinforcements said to be fourteen coss off. A round
shot took off a portion of the roof of our house; but, the enemy's fire
was generally slacker: a number of them are evidently gone off to meet
our troops. Last night, as I was making tea in the store-room, the
largest Bandycoot rat ran through that I ever saw, the size of a little
pig. At night the Tye Khana was so disagreeable that we were obliged to
burn camphor and paper in it.</p>

<p>Saturday, July 25th. My morning duties were rather heavy, having a
large number of clothes to wash; and I have always to take up all the
water I require, and carry it down again when done&mdash;labour that I
thought I never could have been equal to, especially in this country.
Charlie sent me one of his flannel shirts to mend; the front of it was
torn to pieces. He had lent it to an officer of the 48th, who had none,
and who, while wearing it, had had a most narrow escape. A round shot
had come in and covered him with bricks, which had torn the shirt in
the way stated; but he was uninjured. Charlie paid me his daily visit;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
he had been to Mr. P&mdash;&mdash;'s sale. I told him how badly off
poor Mrs. K&mdash;&mdash; was at the Begum Kotee, no one either to get
or cook her rations for her. The day before yesterday her only food
had been a few chupattees, and a cup of tea without milk or sugar.
The enemy are shelling to-day. They sent one into the Dawk office;
it made a hole through the roof, and, falling on the table, smashed
it; but luckily, not bursting, it did no other harm. Some of Mrs.
P&mdash;&mdash;'s things came round for sale, and I bought a silk
dress for twenty-six rupees, as I have lost every one of my own. Mr.
T&mdash;&mdash; came with the order books to-day; it is the first time
I have seen him since the meeting in Cantonments. Mr. A&mdash;&mdash;
also came in the afternoon; both seemed pleased to see me again.</p>

<p>Sunday, July 26th. A letter arrived from the Quartermaster-General
of the relieving force, saying that two-thirds of the force had
crossed the Ganges, and would soon come to our relief; that they had
quite demolished the Nana's force, and that they were strong enough
to bear down all opposition. Glorious news! The Brigadier sent down
an order for all officers to be more watchful than ever, and not to
leave their posts. Charlie has to ask leave to come down and see me
for half an hour. An attack is expected, as a last attempt from the
enemy. Lieutenant L&mdash;&mdash;, of the Artillery, was shot through
the head at the Cawnpore battery. He had just stepped aside to <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>escape
a pool of water, and was shot from a loop-hole. Mr. H&mdash;&mdash;
was sent for to the G&mdash;&mdash;s' to administer the Sacrament to
Mrs. G&mdash;&mdash;, who was dying of cholera; he returned, and we had
service in the entrance-hall: in the evening it was held at the Brigade
Mess. The enemy was discovered mining, to-day, towards the Cawnpore
battery; so we commenced counter-mining: our people could hear the
enemy working a little above them. A luckily-thrown shell of ours fell
on top of their mine, and broke it in.</p>

<p>Monday, July 27th. There has been a sharp attack during the
night, and Lieut. S&mdash;&mdash;, 7th L.C., was accidentally shot
by one of the Europeans. Charlie came in for half an hour, soon
after breakfast; he had a boil on his knee: he said our mine was
progressing well&mdash;twenty-seven feet dug. Dr. P&mdash;&mdash; was
very busy all the morning, getting his galvanic battery ready to blow
up J&mdash;&mdash;s' house; he has had fever for the last two days.
No news from the relieving force, though they said they should send a
letter; it is supposed that all the approaches to the city are strictly
watched. Charlie said that during the night a plan had been sent out of
the entrance to Lucknow, by the Dil Koosha, as it is considered a more
practicable route than the regular Cawnpore road. Firing was very slack
throughout the day. Mr. H&mdash;&mdash; had two funerals.</p>

<p>Tuesday, July 28th. My morning duties, including <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span> washing
clothes, very heavy. No news from the relieving force; firing slack.
We left off the Cawnpore battery mine&mdash;as the enemy had stopped
theirs&mdash;and commenced one in the Sikh square, where we found they
had also commenced. In the evening our people managed to dig direct
into theirs, which we destroyed with a small charge of powder. Col.
H&mdash;&mdash;, who has been laid up with a carbuncle all the siege,
was much worse to-night. While we were at prayers this evening, there
were several volleys of musketry, so there was a call to arms, and
Capt. W&mdash;&mdash; and the gentlemen rushed off to their post.
Nothing, however, followed. Col. H&mdash;&mdash; died during the night;
he has been in a small tent, in the garden, all through the siege.</p>

<p>Wednesday, July 29th. I was awoke by a mouse running over my neck,
scratching me with its horrid little feet. Still no news! After
breakfast I took Miss H&mdash;&mdash;'s duties for her; as, poor girl,
she was not in spirits for it. Charlie paid me his half-hour's visit.
I am so thankful each day to see him once more. After dinner, just as
we came upstairs, guns were heard firing from the Martinière, and upon
the top of the house smoke could be seen from two batteries; a regular
royal salute was fired&mdash;twenty-one guns. All became excited in
the greatest degree, considering it was our relieving force; but we
were doomed to disappointment. No one knows what it was for; <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>but
there is a report that it was in honour of a boy who has been placed on
the throne by the soldiery. An attack expected at night; but all was
quiet.</p>

<p>Thursday, July 30th. Nothing of importance to-day; no news of the
reinforcements. I felt very disheartened, in consequence. Two officers
of the 71st came on Col. H&mdash;&mdash;'s committee of adjustment;
they told us many wounded men had been seen brought into the city.</p>

<p>Friday, July 31st. Another most disheartening day; no news!</p>

<p>Saturday, August 1st. Firing slack; no news!</p>

<p>Sunday, August 2nd. No news again! Mr. H&mdash;&mdash;, 7th L.C.,
died to-day. The relieving force ought to have been in three days ago.
God grant it may come to our assistance shortly! The poor children feel
the want of fresh air and proper food sadly; but, still, we have much
to be thankful for; for, we have, as yet, endured no hardships, and my
dear husband has so far been spared to me.</p>

<p>Monday, August 3rd. Still no news! Firing, during the night, sharp.
The enemy threw several shells, some of which exploded in the Begum
Kotee; but, as yet, without injury to any one. Dear Charlie came and
gladdened my heart. About sunset the shelling became very sharp again;
one burst over Dr. P&mdash;&mdash;'s head, in <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>the air, as he was going
into Mr. G&mdash;&mdash;s'. About 200 of the enemy's cavalry were seen
moving, which caused a little excitement, by no means unpleasing to us
in our present inactive condition. The future is a perfect blank to us;
we are not able to give even a surmise as to what our fate may be: but,
we have made up our minds never to give in, but to blow up all in the
entrenchments sooner.</p>

<p>Tuesday, August 4th. Another day without news. Firing sharp, during
the night. Our only consolation is, that, no news is good news; for, if
any reverse happened to our reinforcements, the enemy would quickly let
us hear of it, and be back upon us immediately. A fine young man was
shot to-day, at the 9-pounder, in our garden; he was shot through the
lungs&mdash;he has left a wife and four children. Charlie came for his
half-hour's visit, my only gleam of sunshine in the gloomy day. I had
an enormous rat in my bedding when I unrolled it in the Tye Khana for
the night.</p>

<p>Wednesday, August 5th. No news whatever; but very few of the enemy
to be seen round us. While Charlie was with me to-day, it came in to
heavy rain, so that I got more than my half-hour's chat; and sent him
home in my blanket shawl, tied in a knot on his head, and hanging down
all round like a cloak. Some of the enemy's regiments of cavalry and
infantry were seen to parade in front of the Redan, and then go <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>off to
the Cawnpore road. Very little firing during the night.</p>

<p>Thursday, August 6th. Another night without news! Poor Mr.
S&mdash;&mdash;, of the 32nd, had his arm broken in three places by a
24-pound shot, and his side hurt so badly that they fear he will not
recover. All are to vacate the Residency to-day, as it is so unsafe.</p>

<p>Friday, August 7th, We were cheered by the news that a Sepoy of
the 1st Oude Irregulars, who had been sent out by the Brigadier, had
returned; he had lost the letter from the relieving force, but had been
in their camp, and seen General H&mdash;&mdash;. He said they had four
European regiments and one Sikh one; and that one European regiment
had a curious baja (music) played in front of them&mdash;meaning the
bagpipes: that our force had had a fight with the enemy, the first
march out of Cawnpore, and taken eighteen guns. A little further on
they had had a fight with villagers, who had decamped, leaving five
more guns in their hands; and then our troops, hearing the Nana was
collecting a force again in their rear, returned to Cawnpore. However,
the Nana took fright, and was off and away; so they took in fresh
supplies, and were coming on again. He also said Shereef O'Dowlah
was the head of the rebels in the district. There were 200 cavalry
with our force, principally volunteers and officers who had lost
their regiments. About 3 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span> the <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>Sepoy
came to see Mr. C&mdash;&mdash;, and we heard all his tale. Whilst we
were sitting in the long verandah room after dinner, there was a call
to arms, and the gentlemen went off to their posts; and I went off
to fetch the things I should require at night, for I knew if there
were an attack I should not be allowed to go into the room where I
dressed. A few rounds from the guns were fired, and the supposed attack
subsided.</p>

<p>Saturday, August 8th. Mr. H&mdash;&mdash; went over to baptize
Mrs. K&mdash;&mdash;'s child, as it was dying. Mrs. B&mdash;&mdash;
and her child are also very ill; indeed, so are all those in that
room at the Begum Kotee. Dr. M&mdash;&mdash;, 41st N.I., and Lieut.
B&mdash;&mdash;, both died of cholera this day.</p>

<p>Sunday, August 9th. Mrs. B&mdash;&mdash; taken ill during the
night, and at 8 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span> a fine boy made his
appearance. I thought of poor Mrs. D&mdash;&mdash;, who, we were told,
was confined in the open at Cawnpore, in the rear of a gun; she and the
child were both massacred afterwards. Mr. S&mdash;&mdash;, and Mrs.
K&mdash;&mdash;'s baby, both died to-day. Mrs. H&mdash;&mdash; rather
angry at being turned out of her room to give place to the new baby.
Mrs. D&mdash;&mdash;, who is expecting her confinement, had a fainting
fit; altogether a nice commotion. In addition to a sharp attack, with
heavy firing from some of the guns close to us, a 9-pound shot came
into Mrs. C&mdash;&mdash;'s room, and just as we were talking of
coming up to sleep in the dining-room again, <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>two shots came in quite
hot, which settled the matter.</p>

<p>Monday, August 10th. A Sikh came in during the night; he said he
had been made prisoner at Chinhut: however, he is thought to be a spy,
and is confined. His account of our reinforcements agree with what
we have previously heard. About 11 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span>,
Lieut. B&mdash;&mdash;, A.D.C., came round to warn all the garrison to
be on the alert, as some regiments had been seen, with their colours
flying, marching from Cantonments. As they crossed the Cawnpore
battery, we fired on them, and the attack then commenced; the firing
was very sharp: shells, shrapnell, round shot, gingalls, and musketry.
I now can distinguish each plainly. Of course, I always feel very
anxious, after an attack, before the list of casualties comes round.
To-day two Europeans were killed, and five wounded&mdash;wonderfully
few, considering the firing was incessant till about 2 <span
class="smcap">P.M.</span> Two of the enemies' mines were exploded, but
without injury to us. About 5, just as we were coming up from dinner,
dear Charlie made his appearance, with some clothes for me; but would
not stop, as he said he had just seen another little army coming up to
the attack; it consisted of two regiments of infantry, some cavalry,
and five guns: he hurried off, and the firing commenced. I much
troubled on his account, for his house has lately been so battered by
round shot, it must be very unsafe; however, <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>Dr. F&mdash;&mdash;
told me he had seen him all right. One of the mines sprung in the
morning, destroying one of the rooms where the Martinière boys are, but
without injuring any one: however, it sent one of the heavy timbers
of the stockade on to the roof of the Brigade Mess (an upper storeyed
house), much to the alarm of the ladies residing there. We heard that
Mrs. O&mdash;&mdash;, of the 48th N.I., had had a little boy during
the night. Just as we were going to bed, another attack commenced;
the night was very dark, but we were providentially preserved through
all.</p>

<p>Tuesday, August 11th. All quiet. I rose early, as my morning
duties are generally very heavy. After breakfast Charlie came; I
felt so thankful to see him safe once more. He told me the enemy,
thirty in number, got into the Compound next us, last night, but were
driven out by hand grenades, &amp;c. During the forenoon, we heard a
rumbling noise, and, on inquiry, found that one wing of the Residency
had fallen, and buried six men; two were dug out alive, but only one
survived it. The rest could not be got out till late in the day.
Charlie told me that the day before, when the enemy's mine exploded
at Sago's, two Europeans were blown out into the road, with their
muskets in their hands, but being uninjured, they jumped up and ran
though his gateway, and through the stockade to their posts again.
From this one may imagine our defences were but slight.</p> <p><span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>
<p>Wednesday, August 12th. There had been incessant firing all night.
No news, whatever, has been brought in! Charlie came and gladdened my
heart; but I must say my own hope of relief was sinking.</p>

<p>Thursday, August 13th. Native reports that our forces are near, and
firing has been heard distinctly in the district from the Redan battery
for two hours&mdash;so hope revives. We countermined and blew up a mine
of the enemy's at Sago's. It was well done, and it is supposed numbers
perished, including the miners themselves, who were heard at their work
just before; several of the enemy rushed down to dig out comrades, but
of them four were shot.</p>

<p>Friday, August 14th. A sweeper came in this morning. Charlie caught
him near the hospital, and carried him to Captain C&mdash;&mdash;'s. He
told them a great deal about the enemy; but, of course, nothing could
be relied on. He said that the Native report was that our force was at
Bushire Gunge. Mrs. F&mdash;&mdash; was very ill, and removed to Mrs.
D&mdash;&mdash;'s room.</p>

<p>Saturday, August 15th. No news from without! We had our beds
brought into the dining-room, and for the first time during the siege
we were to sleep on charpoys (bedsteads). The last three nights in
the Tye Khana I have slept on chairs, to escape the rats; for the
last night I slept on the floor I felt my bedding heaved up, <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>and
a large black rat ran from under it. This is the third time we have
tried to sleep in the dining-room; twice we have been driven out by
shot. This afternoon a shrapnell burst on the roof, wounding two Native
Pensioners and a European sentry; an 18-pound shot also came in.</p>

<p>Sunday, August 16th. The first news we heard was, that a letter had
been brought in from the relieving force; but, to our disappointment,
it proved to be an old one&mdash;the man having been imprisoned. After
his release he had returned to Cawnpore to get further news, but found,
with the exception of a small force entrenched on this side, that they
had re-crossed the river&mdash;the Nana having collected a fresh force.
He also said that numbers of troops were on their way up the country,
and that when a sufficient party had arrived&mdash;which would be about
the 20th&mdash;General H&mdash;&mdash; would again advance. In the
afternoon a shrapnell burst in Mrs. F&mdash;&mdash;'s verandah, close
to her present bedroom; some of the pieces passed over her and Mrs.
B&mdash;&mdash;, going through the venetians, and setting fire to the
chicks; she was brought out and placed in Mrs. B&mdash;&mdash;'s room
with the new baby. I fought against sleeping in the dining-room, as I
thought it dangerous; but, being in the minority, I was obliged to give
in.</p>

<p>Monday, August 17th. We passed the night without an accident,
though the roof was hit by <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78"
id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>round shots. Mrs. F&mdash;&mdash;'s
little boy Bobby very ill; he looks a perfect skeleton: as for Mrs.
D&mdash;&mdash;'s youngest boy, you can count his bones; they are only
just covered with skin. It is a terrible time for poor children; they
pine for fresh air.</p>

<p>Tuesday, August 18th. We were awoke by an explosion of one of the
enemy's mines in the Sikh Square; no one knew they were mining there:
it buried six half-caste drummers and a Sepoy, and blew two officers
into the Square, who escaped with slight bruises. This made a great
breach in our defences, and the enemy might have come in easily if
they had only had a little pluck. Three of the leaders tried to induce
a party to make a rush, but failed; and, two of them being shot, the
affair ended. There was a great firing of round shot and shell, but
only one of our men was killed and none wounded. Bobby had been very
ill all night, and Miss S&mdash;&mdash; sitting up with him; so, at
5, I got up and relieved her, and after breakfast I had to complete
my wash of clothes. No news of our reinforcements! During the day
a sortie was made, and young J&mdash;&mdash;'s house was blown up:
they found eleven men in it, whom they bayonetted; they also blew up
a lot of houses in the neighbourhood. A shell had gone through the
roof of one of them, and underneath there was a large pool of blood.
Two of the enemy's mines were destroyed with their own powder, and
one by pouring a quantity of <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79"
id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>water down it; so they are paid off for
the morning. At sunset Mrs. F&mdash;&mdash; was brought out on her bed
into the verandah for air. At night, as we were all sitting under the
portico, we heard a peculiar cry, three times repeated, and thought it
might be a signal; sure enough it was. Then there was a cry at once,
"Stand to your arms!" followed immediately by a great discharge of
musketry and great guns. All the posts had been warned to be on the
alert, but the attack did not last long. About 3 in the morning, Mrs.
D&mdash;&mdash;'s youngest child died.</p>

<p>Wednesday, August 19th. No news! After breakfast Mrs. D&mdash;'s
poor baby was sewed up by Mrs.&mdash;&mdash; in a clean table cloth,
she having first dressed it in a clean night-dress and lace cap, and
crossed its little arms on its breast; the little thing was carried to
the hospital to await its burial, at night. The day passed as usual.</p>

<p>Thursday, August 20th. No news again! The night had been very quiet.
As I was sitting at the front door at work, a European was shot, at
the gun in our garden, right through the head. <a id="corr22"></a>Mr.
C&mdash;&mdash; was wounded. I had a very bad boil on my hand, for
which I made an ottah poultice; our dinner this day was stewed beef,
dal and rice, and chupattees. We were told, before going to bed, that
J&mdash;&mdash;s' large house was to be blown up at daybreak.</p>

<p>Friday, August 21st. We had a most disturbed <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>night.
There was an attack about 12, and I heard, "Turn out! turn out!" called
from the gentlemen's room; and, being half asleep and half awake, out
I and Mrs. A&mdash;&mdash; rushed from our bed over two other ladies
in our haste; and, much to our amusement, several of them scolded us
famously for making such a rush. We thought, however, we had a right
to leave our bed when we chose, especially as we had about the most
dangerous corner of the room; this amused us so much, that we lay down
again in a fit of laughter. I heard almost every hour strike during the
night. At daybreak, J&mdash;&mdash;s' house was blown up, but it did
not shake us so much as we expected.</p>

<p>Saturday, August 22nd. I rose very early, as I had so much to
do. I was engaged till noon. While Mr. C&mdash;&mdash; was in the
gentlemen's bath-room, a round shot came in and covered him with bricks
and mortar, but did him no injury. This morning, a sortie with about
100 men was made; they blew up some houses, spiked three guns, and
killed many Natives, with the loss of one killed and several wounded;
two, they fear, mortally. The rest of the day passed quietly. Our
dinner to-day was roast mutton, but very little of it, so we opened
a tin of salmon, and Mrs. N&mdash;&mdash;, a woman who has charge of
Mrs. B&mdash;&mdash;'s children, made us a roly-pudding of ottah and
suet&mdash;to us a perfect luxury.</p>

<p>Sunday, August 23rd. I always try to have some clean garments
ready to put on on Sunday, as <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>one way of recognizing
the day. There was service at the Brigade Mess at noon, and in our
house at 3 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span>; Mrs. F&mdash;&mdash;
and Mrs. B&mdash;&mdash; came over to it, and lay on couches.
Col. P&mdash;&mdash; brought over Mrs. P&mdash;&mdash;, Mrs.
B&mdash;&mdash;, and <a id="corr23"></a>Mrs. L&mdash;&mdash;, three
young newly-made widows; Mr. C. D&mdash;&mdash; and Charlie also came.
Mr. H&mdash;&mdash; administered the Sacrament; it was placed on a
small round table, covered with a white cloth: it was an affecting
meeting&mdash;so many had lost friends! Poor Mrs. P&mdash;&mdash; was
sobbing all the time. Mrs. L&mdash;&mdash; had lost both husband and
child!</p>

<p>Monday, August 24th. I rose with a distracting headache, from
the constant firing of the heavy guns during the night; the enemy
sent three round shots into our house, and the guns in our Compound
returned the fire. Mrs. C&mdash;&mdash; was ill with erysipelas. A
Kitmagar came into the entrenchment to-day, but was put in confinement
on suspicion of his being a spy. Mr. G&mdash;&mdash; came about 4
<span class="smcap">P.M.</span> for Dr. F&mdash;&mdash; and Dr.
P&mdash;&mdash; to go to the post office with their amputating
instruments and chloroform, as Mr. M'C&mdash;&mdash;, C.E., had been
shot in the arm; however, they did not consider amputation necessary: a
sergeant and private were shot at Sago's. I could hardly recognise Mr.
G&mdash;&mdash;, he looked so much older with a beard and the effects
of his late fever.</p>

<p>Tuesday, August 25th. A sharp attack on the Bailey Guard Gate
kept us awake the first <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82"
id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>part of the night. I got up and dressed
as I usually do, though it is perfectly useless; we have no safe place
to go to. Mrs. B&mdash;&mdash;'s child kept us awake the latter part.
No news of our reinforcements: very little firing to-day, Mr. and Mrs.
H&mdash;&mdash; came in the afternoon, both so nicely dressed; one
could hardly fancy the siege was going on.</p>

<p>Wednesday, August 26th. Dearest mother's birthday. We had a wretched
night with Mrs. B&mdash;&mdash;'s children and the firing; I actually
lay till 7. I then went down for my cup of tea without milk or sugar,
or rather mug, for I use Charlie's silver mug now; cups have become so
scarce. Dear Charlie sent me a beautiful bouquet of roses, myrtle, and
tuberoses; it is such a treat to have a sight of lovely flowers again!
Oh! the longing one has to be out in the fresh air again! wandering in
fields or gardens. But the useless dreams only do one harm. We have the
stern realities of life before us; so to return to them. I went and
acted as my own laundress; to-day our rations are reduced: gentlemen
get twelve instead of fifteen ounces of meat, and we six instead of
twelve; with rather less dal. A sentry was shot through the leg in our
verandah during the night, and Dr. F&mdash;&mdash; was hit by a spent
ball. After breakfast I mended a pair of Charlie's unmentionables
with a piece of Mrs. H&mdash;&mdash;'s habit, presented for the
purpose: he came for a little <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83"
id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>chat, but a note from the Brigadier
called him away. A little milk-punch is "doled" out to us every day
about 1 o'clock, and I drank dear mamma's health in mine. I sat at the
door till dinner time, 4 o'clock, making flannel garments for myself,
having luckily taken a new piece of flannel into the entrenchments
with me. After dinner the invalids came out and took the air on their
couches at the door; at 7, I made tea for all, then sat at the door
till half-past 8, when we had prayers and went to bed; and I had a
good night's rest, though the children were rather squally. Lieut.
W&mdash;&mdash; 32nd Queen's, killed by a round shot to-day at Mr.
G&mdash;&mdash;'s.</p>

<p>Thursday, August 27th. No news. The enemy fired an immense number
of shot and shells; one soldier wounded in our drawing-room verandah,
but it was his own fault; they are forbidden to go there, as it is
dangerous. Sir H. Lawrence's stores were sold to-day, and fetched
enormous prices: a bottle of honey, forty-two rupees and upwards; a
dozen of brandy, 107 rupees; a ham, seventy rupees; two tins of soup,
fifty-five rupees; a small bottle of pearl barley, sixteen rupees;
twenty bottles of sherry, 110 rupees. People seemed to bid recklessly,
Charlie said; they were to be paid for on the first issue of pay,
which many, I believe, think they will never live to receive. Charlie
bought, instead, a pair of soldier's high-lows, for eight rupees,
from a Sergeant&mdash;quite <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84"
id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>a catch; and far more useful than
truffled larks, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Friday, August 28th. No news again! This is very trying&mdash;the
siege has lasted now more than two months. Every one agrees that the
only plan is to blow ourselves up, if the reinforcements do not come in
time. I rose very early, as Mrs. A&mdash;&mdash; was ill; and having a
great deal of work to do, I did not sit down till 12 o'clock. I have a
chance of having some things washed by a dhobee, but at the exorbitant
charge of twenty-five rupees per 100! more than eight times the usual
charge. We expected an attack to-night, as the Mohurrum and Mussulman
fast is just over; it did not, however, take place.</p>

<p>Saturday, August 29th. Rose and <a id="corr3b"></a>I did all Mrs. A&mdash;&mdash;'s work
again. A Pensioner came in during the night, with a letter, direct
from Gen. H&mdash;&mdash;, dated August 24th, saying he was waiting
for more troops, and could not come to our relief under twenty-four
days; he added, that Sir C&mdash;&mdash; C&mdash;&mdash; had arrived in
Calcutta, as Commander-in-Chief, and was sending up troops as quickly
as possible; that Lucknow would be his first care, and also begging
us, on no account, to treat with the enemy, but rather to die at our
posts. The man who brought the letter said, when he was in General
H&mdash;&mdash;'s camp, a man had come from Delhi, who told him we had
an immense force before Delhi; partly composed of Bombay troops. <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>The
day passed quietly; only the usual firing; no attack.</p>

<p>Sunday, August 30th. When we got up, we discovered our two remaining
Kitmagars had fled. Many Half-castes and Natives left the entrenchments
last night, having heard our relief was not to take place for some
time. Mrs. H&mdash;&mdash; and I had to boil the kettles, in addition
to our morning duties; Manuel, a Madras servant Dr. F&mdash;&mdash;
has just picked up, lighting the fires for us. We all had to help in
preparing breakfast and dinner, and washing up. We had no service till
late in the evening, as Mr. H&mdash;&mdash; had one at the Brigade
Mess, another at Mr. G&mdash;&mdash;s', and a third at the Hospital.
I got perfectly worn out, with running up and down stairs; but I am
thankful to say I am in excellent health, and thoroughly enjoy my
meals.</p>

<p>Monday, August 31st. We were awoke at daybreak, by Mrs.
D&mdash;&mdash; being taken ill. I ran down sharp to light the fire
and boil the kettles&mdash;the former by far the most difficult
operation&mdash;I am very stupid at it, and before it was completed,
down came Mrs. C&mdash;&mdash;, saying the baby was born. It was a
most expeditious affair; they had hardly time to get her into her
own room. Mrs. C&mdash;&mdash; finished boiling the kettle, while I
prepared the early tea-things. I worked really very hard this morning
in the kitchen store-rooms, and it is anything but a joke this hot
weather to have to stand <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86"
id="Page_86">[86]</a></span> before the fire fanning it to make
the kettle boil. I was quite tired out before all was completed;
but I am a perfect wonder to myself. I never thought I was capable
of such fatigue, or was half so accomplished as I find I am. Mrs.
B&mdash;&mdash; and her baby were turned out of the invalid room for
Mrs. D&mdash;&mdash; and her's. Great scrimmage with another Mrs.
B&mdash;&mdash; about her European servant being allowed to cook for
us; we carried our point. The cooking establishment, now, consists of
Mrs. N&mdash;&mdash;, slightly assisted by Manuel and two little boys
from the Martinière school; the latter are useful in the washing-up
department. The enemy tolerably <a id="corr4"></a>quiet to-day, no
shells till 9 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span>, when there was rather a
sharp attack, but not of long duration.</p>

<p>Tuesday, September 1st. Went to my regular work, and discovered
the two Martinière boys were to be taken from us; so there was
another grand scrimmage about washing up plates and dishes. The enemy
brought a gun to bear on the Bailey Guard Gate again. (I forgot to
say that on the 30th ultimo, our miners discovered a mine of the
enemy's close to them; so Mr. F&mdash;&mdash; sat nearly the whole
day in the mine, pistol in hand, waiting for them to pick into it;
they, however, stopped, so we broke into theirs and blew up the
gallery. Lieut. B&mdash;&mdash;, Artillery, was also shot in the
chest, while sitting in the portico of the dawk office talking to
Charlie). This day, Tuesday, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87"
id="Page_87">[87]</a></span> two Artillerymen were shot in the dawk
office compound, while standing by the 18-pounder; the ball, a round
shot, ricocheted from the hospital. One had some property in his box,
and though the officer sent for it immediately, the box was missing;
however, it was recovered before the thief, a brother gunner, had had
time to open it. The looting now is something dreadful; many of the
Crown Jewels have been stolen, and a bottle of brandy will now purchase
a handful of precious stones. Charlie told me he had seen a handful
of pearls, one of them very large, and many of them the size of peas,
which had been purchased for twenty rupees.</p>

<p>Wednesday, September 2nd. The sexton's wife came to help. Mrs.
N&mdash;&mdash;. The enemy were discovered <a id="corr24"></a>mining,
close to the Financial garrison; so we countermined, and blew them
up. Several of the enemy were seen rushing to the spot, to try and
recover their blown-up comrades. A sad occurrence took place to-day!
Lieut. B&mdash;&mdash;, Assistant Engineer, was shot by one of our own
sentries while searching some ground just outside our works, in the
dusk of the evening, to see if there were any mining going on; he was
taken to the hospital in great agony, having been shot through the
stomach. Mr. H&mdash;&mdash; took his poor wife to him; he died during
the night.</p>

<p>Thursday, September 3rd. Nothing particular occurred.</p> <p><span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span></p>
<p>Friday, September 4th. A day without news, and tolerably quiet. Poor
Major B&mdash;&mdash;, who, while trying to get a shot at the enemy,
on top of the Brigade Mess, exposed himself unnecessarily, was shot
through the lungs, and survived it only about ten minutes; those who
went up to fetch his body, had to crawl on their hands and knees. At
night his own Sepoys carried him to his grave.</p>

<p>Saturday, September 5th. Much firing in the early morning. The 13th
Sepoys made a battery for an 18-pounder, at the Treasury, with which
Lieut. A&mdash;&mdash; made some good shots at the clock tower. The
firing ceased a little, when all at once we felt a mine spring, and
immediately an attack was made by the enemy; the firing then on both
sides was incessant. In the midst of it we felt another explode, which
we thought was our own; but it was not: we did however, spring one
during the day, and Mr. F&mdash;&mdash;, and a 32nd man, not having had
sufficient warning, were blown up, but not hurt. In this day's attack
10,000 men were said to be around us; still they did not get in, and
we had only two Natives killed, and two Europeans wounded; one losing
an arm, and the other a leg. It was only Providence who could have
saved us with so little loss: we have great cause for thankfulness!
Our Sepoys are delighted at having a gun at their guard. They say "We
load it, and Aikeen Sahib fires it!" They are <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>behaving splendidly. At
night there was another attack, and the firing lasted about an hour.
A row between the Padre and a lady,&mdash;clerical victorious, and
the lady going off into hysterics. The rest of the gentlemen were out
digging, to repair the defences at the Baillie Guard Gate.</p>

<p>Sunday, September 6th. Several explosions during the morning, as
our people were blowing down walls. At half-past 5 we had service, and
Mrs. B&mdash;&mdash;'s baby was christened, in a little silver font,
and she herself churched. In the night we had another attack. The
musketry was incessant, and the great gun shook the house again. Mrs.
A&mdash;&mdash; and I sat up till it subsided; the mortars close to us
began shelling them: the attack began to subside, and all settled down
again.</p>

<p>Monday, Sept. 7th. Nothing particular occurred.</p>

<p>Tuesday, September 8th. Captain S&mdash;&mdash;, of the Artillery,
died at 4 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span>; he had been severely wounded
at Chinhut, and never recovered it. No news from without!</p>

<p>Wednesday, September 9th. I was awoke by our great guns firing at
the clock tower; at 10 we sprung a mine at the Cawnpore battery. Mr.
A&mdash;&mdash; came and had a long chat. Dear Charlie came while we
were at dinner, and was much amused at my enormous appetite. We had a
dreadful night with Mrs. B&mdash;&mdash;'s youngest child, and poor
little Bobby.</p>

<p>Thursday, September 10th. Tremendous firing <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>at
the mosque, by the clock tower. Two or three 18-pounders at it,
and shelling also, as the enemy have lately occupied it with their
sharpshooters, much to our annoyance. All quiet afterwards. About 2,000
men were seen to leave the City towards Cawnpore. In the evening, and
at night, a number of hackeries followed, it is supposed, with their
baggage. Prices are rising. Twenty rupees given for 2 lbs of sugar, and
one rupee per leaf for tobacco.</p>

<p>Friday, September 11th. A tolerably quiet day, but discoveries made
of "Light Infantry" where they ought not to be. Mrs. B&mdash;&mdash;'s
baby very ill; it has large ulcers all over its body, and inflammation
in the throat. We destroyed two of the enemy's mines to day, and in one
of them men were heard to screech.</p>

<p>Saturday, September 12th. A noise was heard during the night&mdash;a
humming, as of Sepoys turning out of their Lines for a march; and
many were seen in the morning dressed in marching order; they say
the Nana is here, and is sending off his baggage to Fyzabad. Mrs.
B&mdash;&mdash;'s child very ill; mortification must have taken place:
I could not stay in the room. Mrs. H&mdash;&mdash;'s bearer wounded.</p>

<p>Sunday, September 13th. Capt. M&mdash;&mdash;, 32nd, who
commanded our guard, died of cholera; he was taken at half-past
11 last night. We had service at half-past 2, and Charlie came.
Mrs. <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
B&mdash;&mdash;'s baby died in the early morning; it
changed immediately. A spy was caught in the entrenchments, who said
it was reported outside that several of our regiments had crossed the
Ganges at Cawnpore. A very quiet day.</p>

<p>Monday, September 14th. Another spy caught, who said the Nana was
still here, and that there is to be a grand attack to-morrow. Capt.
F&mdash;&mdash; killed by a round shot, while examining the defences
at Mr. G&mdash;&mdash;s'; he was an indefatigable engineer, and
consequently a great loss.</p>

<p>Tuesday, September 15th. Some sharp firing, but no attack. Lieut.
F&mdash;&mdash;, who was sick in hospital, and slightly delirious,
walked over the parapet of the portico; he died shortly after. In the
afternoon a large round shot came in through the top of the house,
passing through two walls and cutting a belt hanging there clean in
two; it then rolled along the roof, without doing any damage.</p>

<p>Wednesday, September 16th. Sharp firing. At 6 <span
class="smcap">A.M.</span> a shell came into the Treasury Guard,
wounding two 13th Sepoys severely and one slightly. We have two people
in the garrison who were in the siege of Jellalabad&mdash;one, the
celebrated Dr. B&mdash;&mdash;, who says, that was a gentlemanly
business compared with this; the other, a queer, dilapidated, old
half-caste, a corporal at Charlie's post, who, some say, was a spy
there, and he says, that was a trifle to our siege. Charlie <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>had
four round shot into his house this morning in a quarter of an hour;
he has certainly been most mercifully preserved. The rest of the day
was quiet. In the evening some horrible smells came from the buried
animals, &amp;c., that we could not sit at the door as usual to take
the air.</p>

<p>Thursday, September 17th. No news! We are beginning to get very
anxious again. They say our beef will only last till the 10th proximo.
The enemy are throwing up another battery, which will sweep the whole
garrison excepting our house; we try, with our shells, to prevent them
working at it. We had a quarter of mutton to-day for dinner, and a suet
pudding afterwards, with some of Capt. W&mdash;&mdash;'s patent sauce,
Mr. C&mdash;&mdash; having begged about a quarter of a pound of sugar
for it; this made twenty people as merry as formerly a dinner with the
Governor-General would have done. Our allowance of beverage for twenty
people is two bottles of indifferent champagne and one of claret and
two pints of beer for two sick ladies. Yesterday, Mr. D&mdash;&mdash;
gave a bottle of brandy and a bottle of sherry for twenty-five
cheerots. Mr. H&mdash;&mdash; found a soldier of the 32nd, with his
head knocked off with a round shot, lying in the churchyard, when he
went to his funerals; so he buried him at once. Queer things happen
sometimes, as I could testify about a Roman Catholic and a Protestant
who had to be buried the same night; on arrival at the burial ground
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
it was doubtful which was which, but it was summarily settled by an
officer present.</p>

<p>Friday, September 18th. We had a slight attack in the night; while
dressing this morning a bullet came into the outer room with such
force that it struck off one side of the frame of a picture, leaving
the glass whole. My labours increase every morning. An eclipse of the
sun was visible between 9 and 11; a tolerably quiet day. As we were
sitting talking in the evening, I ventured to say I thought we had
never passed an hour&mdash;day or night&mdash;since the siege began,
without some firing; I was immediately laughed at, and told <em>not
five minutes</em> even! If this ever reaches my dear ones at home,
they will wonder when I tell them that my bed is not fifty yards from
the 18-pounder in our garden&mdash;there is only one room between
us&mdash;and yet I lie as quietly when it goes off as if I had been
used to it all my life: eighty days of siege life does wonders! This
is getting a most anxious time; if our relief does not come within the
next twenty days we must look for no hope in this world, and we have
heard nothing of them yet; but God is above all, and nothing happens by
chance! I commit all to Him, and if He spares me and my beloved husband
to meet our dear ones in our own beloved country, I will indeed be
thankful; but it is a fearful suspense!</p>

<p>Saturday, September 19th. A tolerably quiet day; but I became very
ill.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
Sunday, September 20th. Still very poorly. We had service and communion
at our house. Charlie came to see me twice, as I was so unwell.</p>

<p>Monday September 21st. No news. Dr. F&mdash;&mdash; ordered me to
keep my bed; there I was in the dining room, all open to the public,
the gentlemen passing and repassing the door: there was no help for it,
however, as it was the only room we could have a punkah in, Charlie
came and sat with me and got Dr. F&mdash;&mdash; to write a certificate
for me to have a little sugar and sugee from the Commissariat, as it
was kept for the sick; he also brought me a bottle of port wine from
the Brigade Mess; but Dr. F&mdash;&mdash; said I must not take it till
I was better.</p>

<p>Tuesday, September 22nd. Still obliged to keep my bed; no news.</p>

<p>Wednesday, September 23rd. Still in bed. No news during the day; but
at 11 at night, came Col. P&mdash;&mdash; cheering us all with the news
that a letter had just come in, brought by Ungud, the same faithful
spy&mdash;saying that our reinforcement crossed the river at Cawnpore,
on the 19th, had a fight at Enown on the 20th, another at Bushire Gunge
on the 21st; and were hastening on to us. The heavy rain we are having
must detain them, but it is glorious news indeed!</p>

<p>Thursday, September 24th. Guns distinctly heard, about ten
or twelve miles off, firing for a length of time, so the troops
must be nearer than <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95"
id="Page_95">[95]</a></span> was expected. I cannot describe our
feelings at our present hope of relief, all are in the height of
expectation. Being a little better, Dr. F&mdash;&mdash; allowed me to
get up. The guns of our force heard approaching nearer and nearer. Oh!
the thankfulness one feels at the certainty of relief now! I think,
if I were stronger, I should be more joyous. The smoke of the guns
seen from the top of the Residency! Oh joy! they say they are only
four or five miles off! but they have to fight their way in! Fifteen
thousand went out to meet them; but, from the heavy rain, took no guns
with them. We had a very disturbed night; the rebels made two furious
attacks, and came up again about 5 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span>, but
were soon silenced.</p>

<p>Friday, September 25th. The guns of our reinforcements commenced
again, and one gun kept firing for an immense time. They say they
are on this side of the Char Bagh, about four miles from us, and
the smoke and flash of the cannon may be seen from the top of
the Residency&mdash;musketry heard distinctly. If they have sent
any messenger on to us, none has arrived; it is a most exciting
time&mdash;far beyond description. The first feeling is gratitude to
God for deliverance from the horrors of famine, which was staring us
in the face, and, apparently, not very far distant. I lay in bed till
after breakfast, as the disturbed night had not done me much good; but
I enjoyed two sugee biscuits dear Charlie sent me the night before for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
my chota hazree, with my tea sweetened with sugar, which I had not
tasted for many weeks. These sugee biscuits the ladies in this house
are buying at five rupees the pound. My longing now is to get a Dhobee
and an Ayah; for I feel so weak and helpless, with not a single person
to help me, and so unable to do anything for myself. Some kind friend
always brings me my meals, &amp;c.; but I feel that they all have as
much as they can accomplish, without doing my work as well. About 12
we heard that the rebels had broken up the bridge near the Char Bagh,
so we decided our troops could not be in for some time; however, all
of a sudden, I heard our soldiers shout out, "They are coming!" their
caps could be seen, and we found they had crossed by the Martinière
bridge. Immediately a fierce firing commenced, and they said the rebels
were flying off to the Fyzabad road. We commenced shelling them:
there was a tremendous day's firing, notwithstanding, and the troops
had a fearful day's work. About 5 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span>
we heard cheering, and, immediately, we saw the troops rushing in,
the 78th Highlanders foremost, and our house, being near the gate,
the Compound was instantly filled. A Mr. W&mdash;&mdash;, an officer
heading the Highlanders, rushed up and shook hands with us ladies
all round, and then threw himself into a chair quite exhausted,
and, in an instant, the whole place was filled with them; it was as
much as we could do to supply them with <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>water. It was by far the
most exciting scene I ever witnessed. The Piper sprang on a chair,
and he and Mrs. A&mdash;&mdash; fraternised. He asked her where she
came from, and when she answered from Edinburgh, he shouted out "So do
I, from the Castle Hill," and immediately sent word round that there
was a lady from Edinburgh amongst us, and then gave another tune on
his bagpipes. The Ferozepore Sikh Regiment also accompanied them, and
some of the Madras Fusiliers. The confusion and excitement was beyond
all description; they lost some hundreds coming through the City.
General O&mdash;&mdash; then came in; he had been wounded slightly in
the arm. Dr. F&mdash;&mdash; dressed his wound. He and his staff took
up their quarters in our house. Strange to say, no one had brought
any provisions, though they confessed they expected to find us in a
worse condition than they did. They said they had hurried on, because
they had seen five ladies and four gentlemen on their way, attempting
to join them, and feared they were some of our garrison; the poor
creatures had all been cut up by the rebels. The news they brought in
from all parts was far more horrible than we expected. At Jhansi the
brutes had burnt the poor children before their poor mothers' eyes,
and then killed the wives, and then the husbands. At Cawnpore they
found only two living beings and a heap of dead women and children,
being those who escaped the massacre at the boats. They say the <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>place
where the murders were committed was a most heart-rending sight; not a
soldier left it with a dry eye. We heard also of the B&mdash;&mdash;s'
of our regiment having been murdered at Hissar. Every one was trying to
get news of his friends; scarcely one but heard bad news. A detachment,
with some guns, was left at Allum Bagh in charge of the baggage and
stores. The men and officers had only just what they wore. During the
night, I heard the soldiers conversing in the drawing-room, where they
lay, and one man said they had made a high caste Brahmin sweep out the
go-down, where the massacre took place. I was obliged to go and lie
down early; but several of the ladies made tea in the Tye Khana, for
any officers who would partake of it, and numbers went down. We had
neither milk nor sugar to give them.</p>

<p>Saturday, September 26th. Several parties went out to take the guns
on the palace side of us; portions of the force are also occupying
the Fureed Bucksh, the Teree Kotee, and jail formerly occupied by the
enemy. Tremendous firing all day. I not seeing my husband became very
uneasy, and found he had been sent out on duty at the Fureed Bucksh. I
passed a wretched night!</p>

<p>Sunday, September 27th. The first thing I heard on awaking was,
that a Sikh was waiting from my husband, asking me for tea, and saying
that Charlie had had no food since yesterday morning&mdash;so I sent
him a bottle of tea and some <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99"
id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>ottah for chupatties. I was only too
thankful to find him alive and well. He afterwards sent me in a cut
glass jug he had plundered, and then came himself, but quite lame from
the boils on his knee. A party went out led by Mr. A&mdash;&mdash; to
take some guns, but unfortunately did not succeed. Charlie came again
in the afternoon, but appeared quite done up; he is now on the sick
list. Miss N&mdash;&mdash; came over, and several other ladies were
walking about&mdash;quite a novelty. I walked down nearly to the garden
gate, the first time since Chinhut, June 30th. We had service in the
Tye Khana, and Mrs. D&mdash;&mdash;'s baby was christened.</p>

<p>Monday, September 28th. I got up, feeling wretchedly weak. This was
to be a day of rest for the troops; however, we rather expected an
attack, as it was the Dusserah&mdash;a very warlike festival. Numbers
were seen crossing the bridges, but it passed off quietly. About 2
<span class="smcap">P.M.</span> came a messenger from Allum Bagh with
news from Delhi, saying our flag was flying on the Cashmere Gate, and
that we were in possession of five gates, the Church, Magazine, and
Mr. Skinner's house, the College, and had fixed a battery at each gate
of the palace&mdash;where the king was&mdash;who had determined to
fight it out. Of course, a day or two must finish it! The messenger
also brought a letter from the detachment at Allum Bagh, saying they
were all right there, but that the enemy had broken up the bridges
between us and them. <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100"
id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>Dear Charlie came at dusk, as he is on
the sick list, and brought me some of his books. Numbers of the "big
dogs" assembled in our house to-day, planning with General Outram; I
fancy the attack to-morrow.</p>

<p>Tuesday, September 29th. A detachment of 800 men went out into the
City at daybreak, and we were continually hearing explosions from the
blowing up of houses; one shook us like an earthquake; they took nine
guns and did their work well. Although we can scarcely call this a
relief, seeing we have to feed the new troops on our own scant rations,
and are reduced in consequence; still they are able to make sorties
now, and have discovered three mines under the Redan, that would
have done us awful damage&mdash;we cannot therefore be too thankful
that they are come in. A piece of shell to-day passed through Mrs.
F&mdash;&mdash;'s little room, and struck the wall by the gentlemen's
dressing-room.</p>

<p>Wednesday, September 30th. A letter in from Allum Bagh, saying they
were all right there, and had not been attacked; great consultations
going on in the General's room with all the "big dogs," and such
sending off of despatches. Charlie came after dinner; his knee was very
bad. In the night the cavalry were all started for Allum Bagh, but the
firing was so sharp that they were obliged to return.</p>

<p>Thursday, October 1st. No news. They were <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>trying to batter down
some houses, near the iron bridge, all the morning, and making a
tremendous noise. Two parties went out: one to take the guns about the
Cawnpore Battery, and the Sikhs to take a bazaar. They were out all
day, going on slowly, but surely. At night, the Sikhs had got as far as
the Painted Magazine, at the corner of the Karse Bazaar; and the other
party had got into some houses close to the Cawnpore road, where they
meant to remain the night. The General and "big dogs" were out all day,
at the top of the Brigade Mess, watching their movements. Dear Charlie
came quite lame&mdash;the doctors say we must all get scurvy, living on
the same food, and so long without vegetables; he brought me some china
and a beautiful punch-bowl&mdash;his own looting.</p>

<p>Friday, October 2nd. Dear J&mdash;&mdash; and L&mdash;&mdash;'s
wedding-day. Where shall we spend our own? Nothing done this day; but
a rumour went about that all the Native troops were to be sent out to
the Allum Bagh: of course, their officers must go with them. If true, I
think it is very cruel to separate us, after enduring our three months'
misery together.</p>

<p>Saturday, October 3rd. They say our troops are still gaining ground
in the City. Several of the enemy's guns were blown up to-day. Charlie
brought me some more china.</p>

<p>Sunday, October 4th. We came out in clean <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>and new dresses,
that we had kept for the relief. Mrs. H&mdash;&mdash; and Mrs.
B&mdash;&mdash; went to service at the Brigade Mess. We had service in
our own house, at 8 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span>: several gentlemen
came; Charlie amongst them. After dinner, I went over to his garrison,
with Dr. P&mdash;&mdash;, and was perfectly thunderstruck to see it
such a mass of ruins. Not a portion, on either side of it, that is
not riddled with round shot and bullets; the verandah all knocked
down&mdash;it is impossible to tell there had been any; there are large
pieces of masonry lying about. From the outside, you would not think
the house at all habitable; and even the centre room, that Charlie
occupies, has immense holes in the walls, made by round shot. He took
me on the roof, as the enemy are too far off to be dangerous now: I
could hardly tell which were the houses that had been occupied by the
enemy, and which by us; there was merely a bamboo stockade between us,
and the marvel is they never got in. I was told, "just down there, a
9-pounder was firing into us night and day, and a little further off
a smaller one." Charlie's post was fired into sharply, day and night;
and I could only feel thankful for his wonderful preservation through
it all. I little thought the fire he had been always exposed to. I
enjoyed a cup of tea with him, of course without milk or sugar; but it
was such happiness to be alone with him again. He gave me a beautiful
manuscript, worked in <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103"
id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>small green and white beads, on pink
and gold paper&mdash;Dr. F&mdash;&mdash; said no doubt done by the
ladies of the Court. At night, a letter came in from Allum Bagh, saying
they were all right, but surrounded by the enemy's cavalry.</p>

<p>Monday, October 5th. The day passed as usual. After dinner we had
such heavy rain, it prevented my going to Charlie's post; he paid me a
visit instead.</p>

<p>Tuesday, October 6th. We had a grand attack; the enemy actually got
into the Fureed Bucksh, but were killed in great numbers. Our troops
were drawn in a little, as it was not considered safe for them to be
out so far. They had got as far as the Delhi Bank, on the Cawnpore
road, but the enemy have it again now, and also Metaz and Dowlah house,
which was said to be filled with jams and pickles, so that our visions
of delicacies were doomed to be blighted.</p>

<p>Wednesday, October 7th. The anniversary of my arrival in Calcutta.
An 18-pound shot came in. The guns are further off now, but I think
more dangerous, for we never know their range now; and two or three
round shots come into the house every day, on all sides. In the
evening, General Outram came and sat with us, and while chatting a
despatch came from Allum Bagh. These despatches are written on thin
paper, and rolled up so small that they are put into a little piece
of the quill of a pen. This brought good <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>news&mdash;that 250
men had arrived at Allum Bagh, with two guns and fifty commissariat
carts, and had met with no opposition on the road. The bridge at Bunnee
was broken, but the river fordable.</p>

<p>Thursday, October 8th. I have resumed my labours, and the whole
morning was taken up with receiving rations of ottah, rice, salt,
&amp;c., and seeing them weighed. Poor Mr. G&mdash;&mdash;, of our
regiment, died to-day.</p>

<p>Friday, October 9th. I took possession of my <a
id="corr10"></a>go-down, at the request of several of our party, and
had all the provisions put under my charge. Captain A. B&mdash;&mdash;
died. Dr. B&mdash;&mdash; brought the news, and went with Mr.
H&mdash;&mdash; to his funeral. A letter came from Cawnpore in the
evening, saying Delhi was entirely ours; but that several regiments
of the enemy, with 18 guns, had escaped, and were coming to Lucknow:
however, a large force of our troops were pursuing them, and hoped to
intercept them before they could reach us.</p>

<p>Saturday, October 10th. A letter from Allum Bagh, saying they were
all right. They are seven hundred strong, and have nine guns. They had
sent out a foraging party, and brought in lots of provisions. We had a
quiet day.</p>

<p>Sunday, October 11th. A busy day with me, for I had to take in the
rations for all for three days. In rice, we were reduced to something
less than 6 lbs. for all the party, for three days. Charlie <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
came to service at 3. No news till night, when another letter came
from Cawnpore, saying the Delhi column had fallen in with the Jhansi
mutineers, killed 150 and dispersed the rest, at Bolundshuhur, on, I
think, the 4th, and were coming on to relieve us, and might be expected
the end of the month. We had two attacks during the night; the musketry
sounded all round.</p>

<p>Monday, October 12th. Dr. F&mdash;&mdash; taken with fever. Three
sales of deceased officers' property took place; Mr. Green's amongst
them. Charlie said 260 of his small cheroots No. 3, fetched 500 rupees.
I heard to-day an officer in our regiment had given a bottle of sherry
for a cake of soap. No news!</p>

<p>Tuesday, October 13th. We had had a great deal of firing during the
night. The day passed quietly. No news!</p>

<p>Wednesday, October 14th. Another day passed as usual. In the evening
came a letter from Allum Bagh. All right there, but the servants were
running away from not being able to get provisions. Reinforcements
expected here about the 25th. A Sikh came in saying other Sikhs were
anxious to come; he had deserted at the commencement of the siege.
He was told they might occupy and keep a house just outside the
entrenchments.</p>

<p>Thursday, October 15th. A quiet day, but all officers are ordered to
remain at their posts till <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106"
id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>further orders, or until the Dewallee
is over, as they say they intend to make a grand attack. The Sikh
yesterday said they knew they could not take our position, but meant to
starve us out, considering all the reinforcements that could come in
time to save us had already arrived. In the evening came another letter
from Cawnpore, and I understand the messenger brought a letter from
Lady O&mdash;&mdash;, at Agra, in which she said they still drove out,
and took the air as usual.</p>

<p>Friday, October 16th. All comforted by getting a grand breakfast of
beefsteaks, a little rice, and dal and chupatties. During this morning
Mr. D&mdash;&mdash;, of the 53rd N.I., who had survived the massacre
at Cawnpore, called and gave <a id="corr5"></a>us full particulars of the whole affair;
poor Mrs. J&mdash;&mdash;, of the 53rd N.I. (she and I were brides
together in Delhi), died in the entrenchments, and he was killed in the
boats, but nothing was known about their children. At the commencement
of their siege they had only 300 fighting men&mdash;soldiers,
shopkeepers, and all included&mdash;and 400 women, and about 200
children. General W&mdash;&mdash; did not make the entrenchment at
the magazine, because he had no idea that there was any ammunition in
it; he thought it was filled with old tents, &amp;c., whereas a great
portion of the ammunition brought against us came from there, besides
what was expended by the enemy at Cawnpore. This seems hardly credible
in a General of Division, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107"
id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>but I believe it is correct. Mr.
D&mdash;&mdash; was in the only boat that got away; they pursued and
fired at them, then the boat struck on a sandbank, and they took to
the water, and their numbers were eventually reduced to four, who were
sheltered by a small Rajah until General Havelock's force arrived at
Cawnpore, when they joined it. He said, he had to swim and wade six and
a half miles after he left the boat.</p>

<p>Saturday, October 17th. My busy day. We had had a slight attack
during the night. Two letters came from Cawnpore, giving accounts
of our reinforcements. They will not be here quite so soon as was
expected. The 93rd are to be at Cawnpore on the 23rd instant, and the
23rd on the 2nd of November. Sir Colin Campbell is coming over here
himself with the troops. I trust they will not delay it too long; for,
famine is too horrible to contemplate. Our daily rations of meat are
now 12 oz. for a man, 6 oz. for a woman, and 2 oz. for a child, and
this is bone inclusive, which is sometimes nearly half; and we have
had 9 lbs. (the ration for our party for one day) of which 5 lbs.
was actually bone. Then seventeen of us (some choosing to have their
rations separate) have 15 lbs. of unsifted flour for our chupatties, 6
lbs. of gram to be made into dal (this is private store food, generally
given to horses), 1 lb. 12 oz. of rice, and a little salt. We generally
make a stew of the meat and rice and a few chupatties, as <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>it
goes farther; but I think the gentlemen generally get up from table
hungry. We have still a little tea, but neither sugar, milk, wine, nor
beer; our beverage is toast and water, a large jug of which is always
placed on the centre of the table; it is made of the old chuppatties,
if any are left of the previous day. All horses under 150 rupees value
were, by orders, destroyed at the river yesterday, as they were eating
up the gram.</p>

<p>Sunday, October 18th. Charlie came at 3 <span
class="smcap">P.M.</span> to service, and was much amused to hear we
were going to have a sparrow-curry for dinner. Dr. F&mdash;&mdash;
had shot 150 sparrows for it; most pronounced it very delicious, but
I could not be induced to try it. I agreed with Charlie to pay Mrs.
B&mdash;&mdash; a visit, as I had not seen her since the Major's death;
so I went with Dr. P&mdash;&mdash; to the Brigade Mess, and Charlie
met me there. I also saw Mrs. P&mdash;&mdash;, who looked very haggard
and worn&mdash;worse than Mrs. B&mdash;&mdash;. The ladies at the
Brigade Mess are all living in dirty little rooms, in a large square;
Mrs. P&mdash;&mdash;'s had only one opening, serving as entrance
door, window, and all. They say the rats are horrible; and I should
think centipedes and scorpions also. At night we had a grand attack,
principally at the Cawnpore battery, Mr. G&mdash;&mdash;'s, and the
Brigade Mess. The firing made more noise than ever I remember; the air
being now so clear, as it is <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109"
id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>the commencement of the cold season, the
guns reverberate tremendously.</p>

<p>Monday, October 19th. No news till the evening, when letters came
in from Cawnpore, saying the Delhi force were within five miles of
Cawnpore, but were fighting with Gwalior mutineers, and that the 93rd
and 23rd Queen's were very near Cawnpore also.</p>

<p>Tuesday, October 20th. My busy day for rations. I also cut out a
coat for Charlie's Sikh subadar, and was fully occupied all day.</p>

<p>Wednesday, October 21st. Our wedding day! so I must give full
particulars of it. I rose at half-past 6, and had a cup of tea and
chupattie and went to my store room and received and weighed the ottah
brought in from grinding, and gave out the wheat for the next day;
also our daily rations of ottah, rice, grain, onions, and salt; then
acted as laundress to myself; at 10 breakfasted, then finished putting
the subadar's coat together, cut out and made a black silk neck-tie
for Charlie, and he sent me over a lot of rupees to keep for Mr.
G&mdash;&mdash;'s estate. I then read till dinner, which was composed
of stewed meat, a little rice and dal, and a chupattie and toast and
water. After dinner, Charlie came for me, as we were to spend the
rest of the day together. I carried over a cup and saucer, teaspoon
and wineglass, the subadar's coat, and a book I had borrowed for
Charlie. I found he had got a pint bottle of <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>champagne&mdash;his
rations for four days at the brigade mess, as sherry and port were all
finished. He, however, would have us finish it at the time, toasting
our noble selves and our dear ones at home; he had made me with his own
hands some sugee cakes with the remains of some sugee I had intended
for him while ill. He had not been very successful; however, the will
was good. He then went and begged a little milk from one that had
that luxury, and I had been presented with a little sugar for the
occasion, and having a little cocoa left of bygone days, I contrived
to manufacture a very delicious cup, which Charlie pronounced capital,
and we thought of the grand dinner we had eaten at the Barrackpore
Hotel that night six years; it was a strange contrast to our half
rations in a battered garret, but I don't think it made either of us
discontented&mdash;only thankful that our lives had been so mercifully
preserved through such awful scenes! No one can see the battered
condition of Charlie's house&mdash;an outpost&mdash;without feeling
that he has been almost miraculously preserved. He walked home with me
about half-past 8, and I went to bed.</p>

<p>Thursday, October 22nd. While dressing this morning, firing was
distinctly heard in the distance. No news in!</p>

<p>Friday, October 23rd. Distant firing heard again. About 3
in the morning, a messenger came in without letters; he had
been obliged to <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111"
id="Page_111">[111]</a></span> put them down a well. He said the enemy
had captured nine of our elephants at Allum Bagh. The day passed
quietly.</p>

<p>Saturday, October 24th. No news! After dinner Charlie came, and
I returned with him; and I had no sooner arrived than a 24-pounder
shot came in! I took tea with him and afterwards came Captain
W&mdash;&mdash; and they examined a Native who had come in. Captain
W&mdash;&mdash; also came. I returned about 8. I always walk very
quickly, both going and coming; but I cannot get over the imaginative
sensation of having a bullet between my shoulders.</p>

<p>Sunday, October 25th. The General came and told us he expected the
Madras column was close to Allum Bagh; he had received no letters, but
a Native had come in. Charlie came to service at 3. The day passed
quietly.</p>

<p>Monday, October 26th. Letters had come in, in the night, with
capital news; the Delhi column had beaten the Mhow mutineers and
taken all their guns, and were coming quickly to us, and that 6,000
troops would be at Cawnpore the 10th of next month and here about
the 15th. Still they cut our rations down again&mdash;14 oz. of
wheat a day for a man and no gram or dal for any one, and a smaller
portion of rice, so that we can only have it once a day now. Just
before breakfast, as I was sitting in the verandah, Col. Napier<a
name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9"
class="fnanchor">[9]</a> <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112"
id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>came up and chatted with me; he had
just been visiting the outposts, and said he had not till then had
a full idea of what we must have suffered, and added, "I understand
your husband has been acting nobly all through the siege." I scarcely
thought till then he even knew my name amongst so many ladies. Col.
Napier was on the General's staff. I, of course, said I was much
gratified to hear such praise; but I went down to breakfast as happy as
a queen, to think dear Charlie was duly appreciated, and to hear his
praise from such high quarters. His position has been a most dangerous
one&mdash;a very exposed outpost&mdash;as the walls will show. This
was the day for the prize auctions&mdash;the property that had been
collected from the palaces. I knew that Charlie was going, but had no
idea that he intended purchasing; however, while I was in my room, Mrs.
C&mdash;&mdash; came running to tell me he had arrived with a most
beautiful Cashmere shawl for me. I ran out, and Charlie threw it into
my arms; this seemed one of the bright days of the siege. He came over
again for me after dinner, and I returned with him to tea, and just at
the time a shell burst in the Compound below his house, but without
damage.</p>

<p>Tuesday, October 27th. Letters had come in again during
the night, saying the Delhi column was expected at Cawnpore
on the 28th. Mr. <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113"
id="Page_113">[113]</a></span> G&mdash;&mdash; was mortally wounded at
the new battery on the mound behind Mr. I&mdash;&mdash;s' house. Dr.
D&mdash;&mdash; was struck by a piece of shell, as he was walking down
to the Ferard Bucksh.</p>

<p>Wednesday, October 28th. Letters came in again during the night,
from Cawnpore, saying the Delhi column had arrived, and they had had
three fights with the enemy&mdash;one near Agra, one at Mynpoorie, and
one nearer Cawnpore,&mdash;and that they had routed them well and taken
their guns; and that by the 7th proximo 2,500 of the troops coming up
country would have arrived at Cawnpore; and that, altogether, we should
be 8,000 strong. The day passed quietly. I went to tea with Charlie,
and while there the enemy commenced a slight attack.</p>

<p>Thursday, October 29th. No news in! A very quiet day.</p>

<p>Friday, October 30th. No news! I went to tea with Charlie; while
there a round shot came in and wounded one of the garrison by causing a
brick to strike him.</p>

<p>Saturday, October 31st. After breakfast Charlie came and put up
my mosquito curtains, as Mrs. A&mdash;&mdash; and I had the luxury
of sleeping away from the party. We had Mrs. F&mdash;&mdash;'s room
to ourselves, Mrs. A&mdash;&mdash; being an invalid. I returned with
Charlie and had a delightful morning. I altered a jacket for him; it is
astonishing how clever this siege has made me in tailoring, &amp;c. I
returned about half-past 3. Everyone thinks <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>it very dangerous my
going to his house; but his room is tolerably safe&mdash;at all events,
as safe for him as me, and it is delightful to have a nice chat
together, for we know not how soon we may be parted.</p>

<p>Sunday, November 1st. Commencement of another month of the siege!
Where will the 1st of December find us? It is coming to a crisis now.
But the Almighty has spared us through so much danger, I trust He will
bring us out of it; my hope now is strong! We had a quiet day; no
news!</p>

<p>Monday, November 2nd. The enemy threw several shells. I went,
notwithstanding, to Charlie's quarters, and had a cosy evening with
him. On my return, as were sitting in the verandah, a letter came from
Allum Bagh, and the General, after reading it, said, he must tell the
ladies the good news. The Commander-in-Chief was to be at Cawnpore this
day, and that part of the force was already sent on to Allum Bagh, and
that the rest remained to escort the Commander-in-Chief, who, it was
conjectured, would push on to Lucknow immediately. The General said he
did not like part of the force being sent to wait at Allum Bagh, as it
would give the enemy the idea that they were afraid to enter Lucknow.
The old gentleman then became very facetious, and asked if we would
take the Commander-in-Chief into our mess in the Tye Khana, <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>and
other little jokes. I afterwards learnt that the arrival of the troops
at Allum Bagh was to be signalled by three salvos of four guns each.</p>

<p>Tuesday, November 3rd. The enemy had been firing tremendously all
night, and this day an attack was expected, so all were ordered to
remain at their posts; Charlie, therefore, could not come to me. I got
Capt. W&mdash;&mdash; to escort me over to his post, and spent a very
pleasant morning with him; I making a cloth jacket. Charlie went with
his men for a few minutes to help to put up the semaphore intended for
the Residency to telegraph with Allum Bagh; the enemy sent a number of
round shot and shell in, during the evening and night.</p>

<p>Wednesday, November 4th. After breakfast, I went over to Charlie's
house, escorted by a Sikh whom he had sent. I must not forget to say
that in my <a id="corr11"></a>store-room I had a very advantageous deal
with Mr. S&mdash;&mdash;, 10 lbs. of green dal and 10 lbs. of wheat for
20 lbs. of rice, so that we can have a little rice with our breakfast
now, as well as dinner. I made great progress with my cloth jacket, cut
out of the surplus part of a habit; no news in! Mr. D&mdash;&mdash;
had both his legs taken off by a round shot, while sketching in the
Residency Compound.</p>

<p>Thursday, November 5th. Gunpowder plot. We had an attack during the
night, and a great deal of firing, but it was quieter during the day,
No news from without!</p> <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116"
id="Page_116">[116]</a></span></p> <p>Friday, November 6th. A
messenger had come in and told the General that Manu Sing had gone off
with his men to Chinhut. I suppose he wishes to be neutral. I spent the
morning with Charlie. A 24-pounder came in and wounded a poor woman
by the bricks it dislodged. I completed my cloth jacket, and Charlie
gave me some bloodstone buttons for it. In the evening, after Mrs.
A&mdash;&mdash; and I were in bed, Mrs. H&mdash;&mdash; came in to tell
us that a letter had come from Cawnpore, saying 5,000 Infantry, 800
Cavalry, and 36 guns, with 400 of the Naval Brigade, would be at Allum
Bagh by the 10th at latest. Glorious news for us prisoners!</p>

<p>Sunday, November 8th. A quiet day&mdash;no news! Charlie came to
prayers, and I went to tea with him.</p>

<p>Monday, November 9th. Another quiet day! I spent the morning with
Charlie.</p>

<p>Tuesday, November 10th. A great deal of firing at Allum Bagh;
several considered the four salvos that were fired the signal of the
arrival of the troops, but others thought they were only signal guns.
Mr. C&mdash;&mdash;, assistant to the Chief Commissioner, had gone
out during the night to Allum Bagh, disguised as a Native, and during
the morning the General sent word to his wife that his arrival had
been signalled. At 8 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span> a tar barrel was
lighted at the top of the Residency, for some signal or other, and
was answered from the Allum Bagh.</p> <p><span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span></p> <p>Wednesday,
November 11th. There had been a good deal of firing during the night.
No news in! A very unexciting day; they tried to work the semaphore,
but from some mistake it did not answer.</p>

<p>Thursday, November 12th. I spent the morning with Charlie, arranging
and packing our worldly goods; for, if the troops come in, we may be
sent off at a moment's notice. We could see the semaphore working
famously to-day for full three hours, and afterwards were told that
Sir C&mdash;&mdash; C&mdash;&mdash; had arrived at Allum Bagh, Mr.
C&mdash;&mdash; was all right there, and they did not intend commencing
operations till Saturday the 14th&mdash;all glorious news! While I was
with Charlie, there was a Native report that the troops were already
coming in and the enemy flying, so several officers came to Charlie's
to see from the roof of his house whether it was true; it turned out
all false. After dinner, Mrs. B&mdash;&mdash; and Mr. C&mdash;&mdash;
called, the latter I had not seen during the whole siege; he was
looking better than I expected to see him, but his knee was much
contracted from the wound he received in Cantonments the night of the
mutiny. About 7 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span> there appeared to be
an attack commencing, but the firing did not last long&mdash;however,
all officers are ordered to remain at their posts till the troops come
in.</p>

<p>Friday, November 13th. I spent the whole morning packing the
few worldly goods I have <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118"
id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>left, and the Oude china, for we
may very probably be sent off at a moment's notice. After dinner,
I went over to Charlie; we had a very quiet day. In the evening, a
messenger came in from Allum Bagh but he had lost his despatch, so
he was packed off to the Guard-house immediately; for, considering
it had been telegraphed from Allum Bagh that the troops would move,
without fail, the next morning, this letter might have been of infinite
importance.</p>

<p>Saturday, November 14th. The troops moved from Allum Bagh. It was
a very exciting day to most people; but somehow or other I felt very
tranquil. I spent the morning with Charlie. The troops took possession
of the Dil Koosha and Martinière, and by the evening our flag was
waving over the latter building.</p>

<p>Sunday, November 15th. The General went out with his Staff at 10
<span class="smcap">A.M.</span>, but from some cause unknown to us,
neither our troops made any sortie nor the reinforcements any advance.
I paid Charlie a visit after dinner.</p>

<p>Monday, November 16th. A most exciting day. The troops moved from
the Martinière at half-past 6; we heard the guns firing tremendously.
I went over to Charlie about 11 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span>; the
roof of his house was crowded with spectators. They had just seen some
of our Cavalry and Artillery take two of the enemy's guns, on the road
to the Motee Mohul, and plant two of ours <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>in their stead, drawn by
grey horses; some of the Lancers were distinguished by their peculiar
caps. Our own force, from entrenchments, moved out also from the
Fureed Bucksh, and took the Engine House and King's Stables, and all
the buildings up to the Nullah. About half-past 12 I went on the roof
(or rather stood at the head of the stairs, looking through a hole in
the parapet, that had been made by a round shot), and saw the mines<a
name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10"
class="fnanchor">[10]</a> sprung, and the batteries firing furiously
behind the Chutter Munzel. It was a most extraordinary scene! shells
were bursting in the air above them,&mdash;fired, I suppose by the
enemy,&mdash;and every few minutes a new mine was sprung, sending up
a thick yellow smoke and dust quite different from the smoke of the
batteries. We saw one round shot strike a bungalow, on the banks of the
river, and immediately some figures sprung up from the verandah and
made off with their bundles of bedding. Many rockets were also fired,
which set fire to several buildings, and then volumes of thick smoke
and flame arose. At one time a mine was sprung, far out in the distance
(conjectured to be some magazine of the enemy); very few were seen
running away; every now and then, two or three would swim the river,
having first stripped and tied their clothes on their heads. A few ran
away in our direction, through Phillips' <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span> garden, so Charlie
placed a rifleman to pick off any who might be seen flying in that
direction. He would not allow more than fourteen on the roof of his
house at one time; it was in such a battered condition, it was not safe
to have more. It was doubtful even if the concussion from the mines
might not shake it too much, so a Crannee and a Sikh were placed to
keep too many from crowding up; and when some parties had been long
enough, they were sent down, and others took their places. There was
always a party of European soldiers waiting to go up: the house stands
high, and commands the part of the city our troops are entering. I was
quite sorry, when dinner-time came, and I was obliged to leave, for
it was the most exciting scene I ever in my life witnessed. I little
thought even when I "listed," that I should ever witness a pitched
battle, and that my own life should depend on the issue of it: it is,
indeed, mercifully ordained that we shall not see into the future.
About 6, the General and his party returned. Our troops had got up to
the Motee Mohul, on one side, and to the Nullah on the other, so that
the two parties were only separated by a few hundred yards.</p>

<p>Tuesday, November 17th. The General and his Staff went out to meet
Sir C&mdash;&mdash; C&mdash;&mdash;. I went over to Charlie, but there
was not much to be seen from his house, and there was a 24-pounder in
the Dawk Office Compound, just below his <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>window, which,
when it fired, regularly blew a blast into the room, much to my
annoyance. I returned to dinner; and when the General came home
in the evening, he said, as he passed into the house, "Ladies, I
have seen the Commander-in-Chief." The communication was now opened
with our troops; some of his staff remained talking with us,<a
name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11"
class="fnanchor">[11]</a> and we then heard that Col. N&mdash;&mdash;,
and Mr. S&mdash;&mdash;, A.D.C., had been wounded. The General had
rushed across to the Commander-in-Chief, through a heavy fire. After
prayer in the evening, he called Dr. F&mdash;&mdash; aside, and said a
few words to him; and when Dr. F&mdash;&mdash; came back he said: "All
ladies, and the sick and wounded, are to be out of the garrison before
to-morrow night, and can only take what they can carry in their hands."
It came upon us like a thunderbolt; one felt almost paralysed&mdash;so
helpless! How were we to go, and what could we take with us? We were
told not to name it; out of our own garrison that night, or else I
should have gone off to Charlie at once. Several of the ladies sat up
all night, stitching things of value into their petticoats, &amp;c.;
I sat up a little while, but I got such an internal shivering and
spasms with the start it had given me, that I was obliged to go to bed,
fearing I might get one of my attacks; of course, sleep was out of the
question.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122"
id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>Wednesday, November 18th. I got up at
daybreak, and rushed over to Charlie. I found him fast asleep, but
awoke him with the news, which he would not believe; however, he got
up and gave me all sorts of instructions how to manage, and said he
would set off and see if he could contrive anything for me. I went
home again to stitch my valuables around me; and, by dinner time he
had got me two old men&mdash;fathers of Sepoys who had been with us
all through the siege&mdash;one of whom was to carry a bundle of
bedding, and the other my dressing case; our only servant, a punkah
coolie, was to carry a tin box: he cheered me with the news also,
that he had got leave to accompany me as far as Secundrabagh.<a
name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12"
class="fnanchor">[12]</a> So I must walk, having no carriage; however,
there came an order that we were not to go till the next day. I was
thankful, for I was quite worn out with the preparations. Charlie,
also, was quite done up, he had been over so often to help me; and
we are none of us very strong; and after all he brought me 2 lbs. of
sugar, a great treat, for we had tasted none for weeks. We went to
bed all worn out, Charlie sending word, the last thing, that I was
to have the Subadar's mare to ride the next day. The Sikh cook was
to carry a banghy; so I set to work and packed my little portmanteau
with what next I thought I should most like to save (the difficulty
was to select), and <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123"
id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>all these things went off at night with
Herah Sing, a Sikh Sepoy in charge. Charlie had given him a note to
Col. B&mdash;&mdash;, to take charge of them till I arrived next
day; but, the Colonel was killed that very afternoon&mdash;so Capt.
N&mdash;&mdash;, Assistant Adjutant-General, kindly took charge of them
instead.</p>

<p>Thursday. November 19th. Charlie came over the first thing, and
said Capt. W&mdash;&mdash; had lent him a coolie, so I had to pack
another box, and as Herah Sing had invested thirty-five rupees in
a pony (without orders) for me to ride, I got a side-saddle from
Mrs. F&mdash;&mdash;; and then came the news that the Brigadier had
cancelled Charlie's leave, as so many had been applying for the same.
It gave me a sharp pang indeed, for this may be our parting in India;
however, it was no time to give way, so I dressed in all the clothes
I could, fearing I might not be able to get my boxes carried on from
Secundrabagh. I put on three of each kind of under garments&mdash;a
pink flannel dressing-gown, and plaid jacket, and then over all my
cloth dress and jacket made out of my habit. I then tied my Cashmere
shawl round my waist, and also Charlie's silver mug, and put on a
worsted cap and hat, and had my cloak placed on the saddle; in my
pink dressing gown I had stitched dear mamma's last present to me,
and I filled several pockets with valuables also; in two under ones
I had all my little stock <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124"
id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>of jewellery, and my journal, and some
valuable papers. I also wore a bustle, in which I had stitched my
Honiton lace wedding dress, veil, &amp;c., and two black and white lace
shawls; so that I was a pretty good size. At half-past 10, Charlie
and Capt. W&mdash;&mdash;, with great difficulty mounted me on my
pony,&mdash;a very difficult affair dressed and laden as I was and
with no spring in me. Capt. W&mdash;&mdash; and a large party, were
in fits of laughter; at last it was accomplished, and Charlie took me
out to the Baillie Guard Gate, and there we parted with a shake of
the hands, not knowing when we might meet again! My heart was very
heavy, but it was no time to give way. Herah Sing led my pony very
carefully. At last we came to a part that was dangerous; the enemy
commanded it from the Kaiser Bagh, and the musket shots were whistling
about, so some soldiers advised my dismounting and walking through the
trenches which had been cut for us. I did so; and when I came out at
the engine house an officer came forward to meet me and congratulated
me and offered his assistance. I said I was waiting for my pony, so
he offered me his charpoy to sit on till it came round and sent his
Orderly to look for it; at last it came, and he took me through some
barracks to meet it, and there attempted to mount me, but of course
unsuccessfully. At last, however, with the assistance of a tall
soldier and Herah Sing, and a chair, I was got up again, and <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>then
he begged to know my name that he might tell my friends he had sent me
on safely, and I asked to whom I was indebted for so much kindness? He
said, "Mr. F&mdash;&mdash;, of the Artillery;" and when I named Capt.
G&mdash;&mdash; he said, "Oh! I know G&mdash;&mdash; very well, and I
will be sure to tell him you are all right!" So on I went, steadily,
till I came to another dangerous part, when another soldier told me
I had better dismount; but I thought of my former difficulties, so I
made Herah Sing double the pony across, the balls whistling over our
heads. When we got to Secundrabagh, there were the 93rd Highlanders in
their kilts and bonnets, and the Naval Brigade with their great guns.
I spoke to one of the sailors on a 24-pounder, and asked if there
were any place appropriated to the ladies? He jumped off, and said he
would show me the way, and congratulated me on getting out of Lucknow,
and asked if he could do anything for me? He said his name was Mr.
H&mdash;&mdash;, and he belonged to the <cite>Shannon</cite>, and that
he might be found at any time at that gun if I sent for him. He then
told me of the <a id="corr25"></a>fight they had coming in, and that
1,842 Natives had been killed in that very garden; the bodies were
counted as they were buried: he said they lay in heaps breast high.
I took up my position in the corner of a verandah, as it was cleaner
than the house. Mrs. B&mdash;&mdash; was the only lady arrived. Herah
Sing drew me some water, and I took out <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>a ham sandwich Charlie
had given me in the morning&mdash;his own breakfast&mdash;for they
had had a ham at the Brigade Mess, one that had been kept in store as
a treat to be eaten when the relief arrived. While I was eating it,
Captain C&mdash;&mdash; came up and offered to do anything for me; so
I asked for a hackery to take on my baggage. He said he could give me
camels, but I preferred a hackery as I might be able to sit on it if
my pony broke down. He gave me some sherry, and said he would send me
some bread and butter&mdash;a great treat. He left, and then came Mr.
H&mdash;&mdash; again and asked if I wanted anything, and sent me a
loaf of bread. I asked him to get me some ropes, in case my baggage
had to go on camels, which he did; and then came Capt. C&mdash;&mdash;
again with his rezie and pillow for me to sit on, and his Kitmagar
with bread and butter and cold mutton and a bottle of beer. I ate a
little, and then asked him to cut sandwiches for me, of the rest, for
night; which he did, and I put them in my basket with the bottle of
beer. About the middle of the day came Miss H&mdash;&mdash; and Mrs.
S&mdash;&mdash;; they had walked all the way. About an hour after, came
Mrs. H&mdash;&mdash; and Mrs. B&mdash;&mdash; and her baby in a buggy;
they came to my corner, and our party remained together all day. Every
other place was filled with ladies and children, soldiers' wives and
Crannies' wives. We were to move on to the Dil Koosha in the evening,
which we were glad to <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127"
id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>hear, for the smells here were
intolerable. About dusk they began to make preparations, and the place
was one mass of camels, bullocks, carriages and human beings; the same
outside, in front of the gateway: so great was the confusion that Capt.
C&mdash;&mdash;, who had been ordered to keep the road open, gave it up
in dispair, and came and said it was utterly impossible to do so; he
had left a string of camels entangled in a ditch, and the road was one
mass of entanglement; he was, however, obliged to go off again, and it
became pitch dark; and there we were, left to our own devices: how we
were ever to get on, none of us could tell. However, at last I decided
my best plan was to load my pony with my bundle of bedding, and walk
myself, and the rest of my baggage must take its chance; the coolie who
had night blindness, and one of the old men, must remain with it, and
get Capt. C&mdash;&mdash; to send it on in a hackery next day. I got a
soldier of the 9th Lancers, named Mitchell, to load the pony for me;
he was very civil, and did all he could for me: we then sat down in
the dark, patiently, till we should get our orders to move; the enemy
were out between us and the Dil Koosha, and we were not to go without
a large escort, which was to be ready at 8. A little before that time
came Capt. E&mdash;&mdash;, to say the enemy were out so strong that no
carriages of any kind were to go on that evening, we must hurry with
all speed to the Dil Koosha, but must go a <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span> roundabout, sandy road,
and must run no risk of being hindered by carriages sticking in the
sand: as many dhoolies (palanquins for the sick) as could be procured
would be in readiness for the ladies, and those who could not get them
must walk. Soon after, fortunately, came up Mr. O'D&mdash;&mdash;,
who said our only plan would be to go and take possession of empty
dhoolies ourselves; so off we set, he dragging us through the entangled
mass&mdash;far worse than any London mob&mdash;and he put us into
four dhoolies, nearly all separated. I called to my old man to bring
the pony and bundle of bedding, but that was utterly impossible for
the time; we waited some time in the dhoolies, and then mine and Miss
H&mdash;&mdash;'s were ordered somewhere to the front, but in quite
a different direction to what I considered the right road to the Dil
Koosha. We heard the enemy firing in the distance: never shall I
forget the confusion of that night&mdash;the masses crowded together
in the pitch darkness; for even when Mrs. B&mdash;&mdash; had a
candle lighted, thinking her baby was dying (its breath having been
caught by the cold air), it was ordered to be put out immediately,
on account of the number of ammunition waggons. I think we must have
started about 9; we went on steadily for some distance, and then some
of the advanced guard came riding back, telling the dhoolie-bearers
not to speak a word, the enemy were so near; so on we went, nothing to
be heard but the tramp of <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129"
id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>the bearers; after a time we were all
halted, and not allowed to make the slightest noise, the enemy were so
close. After a time, on we went again in silence, a very roundabout
way, and when I looked at my watch after our arrival, I found it had
stopped at ten minutes past 2. Now, the direct road would only have
been two miles. We were kept waiting on our arrival for some time, for
they said there was no place ready for us; we were turned back from the
house, as there were already 1,100 sick there. After waiting about an
hour in the cold, I seized a gentleman who was passing with a lantern,
and asked him where we were to go; he pointed to some tents a long way
off, and after tumbling over innumerable tent-pegs and ropes we reached
them, and lay down on the ground for the night&mdash;for it was utterly
impossible to find my pony with the bedding&mdash;but we got a rizie
(quilt) to lie upon, and I put my head on my basket. The tents were
so open that I, of course, got a severe cold; however, daylight soon
appeared.</p>

<p>Friday, November 20th. As soon as day dawned I went all over the
immense camp in search of my pony. I found several ladies had passed
the night in their dhoolies; Mrs. B&mdash;&mdash; fortunately had a
small tent of her own, so she went straight off to the commissariat
officer and asked him for a place for it, and kindly asked me to share
it with her; it was such a luxury, when it was pitched, to get <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span> into
it by ourselves, and I had found the pony, with my bedding, so when I
was dressed I lay down on it and rested, for I felt quite worn out.
We spent the day quietly; in the afternoon, to our great delight, Mr.
C&mdash;&mdash; brought us a packet of overland letters. Oh! the joy
of having them once again, and finding all our dear ones at home were
well; we had received none for many months. My hackery arrived, just
after, with my worldly goods; Capt. C&mdash;&mdash; had kindly sent
them on from Secundrabagh, so that I began to feel more comfortable. We
went to bed very early, to recruit our strength.</p>

<p>Saturday, November 21st. I rose early, and took home some newspapers
that had been lent me, in one of which was an account of poor Mrs.
B&mdash;&mdash;'s murder at Hissar. On our return we drew our
rations&mdash;bread, meat, tea, sugar, rice, dal, and salt&mdash;a
bountiful supply: I then sent off the coolie to Charlie with a note,
and he sent me back a charpoy (bed) and some other things, so I had no
longer to sleep on the ground.</p>

<p>Sunday, November 22nd. A quiet day! But we have no service, although
there were six Padres in the camp. In the evening, to our joy, we heard
the old garrison were leaving Lucknow, and might be with us that night.
Mrs. B&mdash;&mdash; and I sat up till Davie came and told us they
could not be here till the next morning.</p>

<p>Monday, November 23rd. Rose early, and <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>went out to enquire
for our husbands, and found they had arrived, but were kept in
a camp, about a mile off. We waited impatiently till 4 <span
class="smcap">P.M.</span>, when Mr. B&mdash;&mdash; made his
appearance; he said he had waited all day, to ask the Brigadier's leave
to come up; but the Brigadier had been away himself all day with his
wife; so he set off without leave, and met him just returning. About
sunset, in came dear Charlie, limping sadly; he was loaded with a
sword, carbine, haversack, case bottle, and a stick to help him along;
he had gone on the sick list, for his knee was so bad, he did not feel
equal to marching. He had tea with us, and then stretched his bedding
outside our tent, under the awning of it, so as to escape the dew; but
I longed to give him shelter, it was so cold. We packed all ready for
starting, as we were to march in the morning; but the hour was kept
secret, on account of the enemy.</p>

<p>Tuesday, November 24th. Charlie called us at 6, thinking we should
be off early: however, we did not start till noon. All the ladies were
ordered to collect in front of the Commander-in-Chief's tents, when all
those who had no private carriages, would be stowed away in covered
hackeries: the dhoolies were all kept for the sick. We were late, for
Mrs. B&mdash;&mdash; would not <a id="corr26"></a>leave in her buggy
till the Bheestie was ready to accompany her. I mounted my pony, and
we tried, with Charlie's assistance, to make our way through <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>long
lines of baggage, hackeries, camels, bullocks, &amp;c., &amp;c.; never,
I believe, was such a scene! The whole army marched, excepting a few
to keep the Dil Kooshe for a short time. There were 1,000 sick carried
in dhoolies, and 467 women and children, in any kind of conveyance
that could be got for them, added to Sir C&mdash;&mdash;'s whole army,
a portion of which consisted of nine batteries: never shall I forget
the scene! As far as the eye could reach, on all sides were strings
of vehicles, elephants, camels, &amp;c., &amp;c.; and when we were
all pitched for the night, our camp extended over seven miles. The
dhoolies were all kept for the sick; none were allowed even to ladies
who were hourly expecting their confinement: Sir C&mdash;&mdash;
said the wounded men must be first thought of, as they had saved our
lives. The dust was overpowering! We went across country to avoid the
enemy. Our road was over cultivated fields; such ups and downs! It
was a wonder how the vehicles surmounted them. Most of the carriages
were drawn by bullocks, as the horses had been too much weakened by
the siege to be of any service. Being such tremendous lines, we were
frequently stopped by entanglements; and though we had only four or
five miles to go, we did not get to our ground till dark. The number
of guns with the force added immensely to the number of vehicles
accompanying us. As I said before, we had nine batteries, the Naval
Brigade included, and the <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133"
id="Page_133">[133]</a></span> Artillery park and magazine attached is
tremendous. There were also innumerable commissariat carts, and many
with treasure from Lucknow, the Commander-in-Chief with one division,
and General O&mdash;&mdash; with another. General H&mdash;&mdash; died
this day of dysentery. We heard distant firing all the way, and hoped
it was not on the little party left at the Dil Koosha. I could not
possibly describe the confusion when we arrived at our encamping ground
for the night. I had been obliged to get off my pony, as the sun was
so powerful, and get into a hackery, and "squat" down on the straw,
like most of the other ladies; but when we got to the ground, we had to
hunt about for our baggage, the little we had brought with us. Luckily,
Charlie got hold of our baggage hackery, and got down my charpoy for
me to sit on; but it was bitterly cold, so that Mrs. B&mdash;&mdash;
took her baby into some officer's tent till her own could be found. We
had brought a little bread and meat in a cooking vessel&mdash;our day's
rations; also tea and sugar. I had purchased some cheese at the Dil
Koosha, so Mrs. B&mdash;&mdash;'s Ayah, a Musselmaunee, set to work and
boiled the kettle on the ground, and then fried the beef in a little
frying pan I had brought, and we had a grand tea: beef, and bread and
cheese, and tea with milk and sugar in it. It revived us a little, but
poor Charlie seemed quite done up; and poor <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>Mrs. B&mdash;&mdash;
had been nursing her baby all day, without taking anything herself.
Luckily, up came Mr. B&mdash;&mdash; with her camels and tent; he had
been searching for them: it was soon pitched, and we were in luxury
compared with most; for many poor delicate women and children passed
the night on the ground, by the side of their hackeries, and the nights
are bitterly cold now. The hackeries were too full for all to lie
down in them. Charlie put his bedding partly under the awning of some
tent, to escape the dew, which is very heavy; and it is very dangerous
sleeping in it.</p>

<p>Wednesday, November 25th. We halted&mdash;and really needed it.
Charlie drew his own rations, and we had all our meals together, and
got on very happily though not in great comfort. Mrs. B&mdash;&mdash;'s
Ayah did all the cooking for us, and made some delicious pourries for
tea. We went to bed at 8, very tired. Charlie slept this night in a
dhoolie.</p>

<p>Thursday, November 26th. We expected an order to march, but did not
get it; a party of the 8th Queen's and some Engineers went on ahead to
repair the Bunnee bridge for us, so we halted this day also.</p>

<p>Friday, November 27th. An order was given for us to march at 7 <span
class="smcap">A.M.</span>, but just as we had prepared everything for
starting we were told we were not to go till after breakfast. About
11 we started, and went about thirteen miles, encamping for <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>the
night two miles on the Cawnpore side of Bunnee. I was very tired with
the jolting of the hackery.</p>

<p>Saturday, November 28th. While we were still in bed, came an order
to strike tents and be off; it seemed almost more than one could
do: we hurried and dressed, and had a little breakfast, and I was
in the hackery by 8! We had tremendous work to get out of the crowd
of hackeries starting and get into the line, and it was half-past
9 before we really began our march. We heard very heavy firing at
Cawnpore all day, so that the Chief ordered us not to halt at Enown,
but march the whole way in to the banks of the river&mdash;thirty
miles&mdash;he himself hurried on to Cawnpore, and it was fortunate
he did, for the Gwalior mutineers had been there three days; and this
day, the 64th Queen's, returning from spiking some guns, lost 7 or 8
officers; indeed, all that went out with them: and an officer of the
70th had to bring them out of action. I jolted on in my hackney from
8 in the morning till 12 at night, the life almost jolted out of me;
luckily we had bread and cheese and a bottle of beer with us. Charlie
dragged on his weary way, first walking and then in the hackery, but
he was quite done up at last; and yet, when we got to the encamping
ground, we were two hours more searching for Mrs. B&mdash;&mdash;'s
tent: it was 2 o'clock before I got in. Then, of course, our baggage
hackery never arrived till late the next <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>day; so we had to
contrive and boil a little water in a lotah, so as to have a cup of
tea, and then we lay down,&mdash;Charlie outside and I in the tent with
Mrs. B&mdash;&mdash;.</p>

<p>Sunday, November 29th. We hoped to be allowed to halt, but an order
came that we were to go two miles nearer the river, and to form a very
compact camp on account of the enemy. We started again, and got to
camp in the middle of the day; had the tent pitched in a nice turfy
spot, and were having dinner all comfortably, when another order came
that we were to cross the river that night! This was killing work, but
we afterwards heard the enemy intended firing on the bridge of boats;
luckily, Sir Colin had a battery up close to it, and kept them off.
No doubt it was a most anxious time to him&mdash;but we did grumble
occasionally, as he did not appear to think much of our comfort. Mrs.
S&mdash;&mdash; was confined in her dhoolie while changing ground this
morning. At 8 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span> we started&mdash;all the
baggage hackeries were to be stopped for us ladies to cross the bridge
of boats; but in consequence of some of them having "dodged" into
the line, it took us eight hours to do the three miles; fortunately,
it was a splendid moonlight night; just as we were on the bridge of
boats there was a sudden discharge of musketry, which greatly alarmed
us. I thought for certain the enemy were going to attack us, but
it turned out to be our own men firing in the entrenchment; <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>we
happened to have stuck just at the time, and the bridge of boats is
so narrow we could not have escaped. I own I was more frightened this
night than any time during the siege; however, we got safely to the
Artillery barracks, where we were to halt; some very dirty crannies
had taken possession before us. However, we lay down on our bedding
which we had brought in the hackery with us and slept till 8 <span
class="smcap">A.M.</span></p>

<p>Monday, November 30th. We waited on in misery till the tent came up,
which was not till late in the day, and then we found the Bheesti, our
factotum, had fever, and could not work; however, Charlie managed to
get the tent partly up, when another order came to move to some other
barracks half a mile off. In the midst of it all, Charlie contrived
to hurt his bad knee against a tent-peg. Some started for these new
barracks, and we were preparing, when a counter-order came that we were
to wait till morning; so we got our tent up, and slept in it.</p>

<p>Tuesday, December 1st. We took our chota hazree, and then went
to our new quarters, where we pitched our tent, and made ourselves
comfortable, and we were actually allowed to remain in peace for the
rest of the day.</p>

<p>Wednesday, December 2nd. We hoped to remain in peace, and the
Brigadier asked Charlie what sort of an appointment he would like;
but, unluckily, he was totally unfit for work, and so <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
obliged to decline all. About sunset came an order for us to march that
night (we had just returned from visiting General W&mdash;&mdash;'s
entrenchments), and no gentlemen were to accompany us but Captains
E&mdash;&mdash; and B&mdash;&mdash;. Charlie had not yet got his sick
certificate from Dr. C&mdash;&mdash;, so I was in a sad state of mind,
fearing we must now separate altogether. We set to work dividing our
clothes, &amp;c., as best we could, but we were both excessively tired.
I did not lie down till 12, midnight, and then did so fully dressed,
expecting every moment to be ordered off. I had a most distracting
headache; however, the night passed on, and we did not move.</p>

<p>Thursday, December 3rd. I woke Charlie at daybreak, and he went off
to the superintending surgeon, to see if he would sign his papers, and
then was told to come at noon: at noon he went, and did not return till
4, when he said he had got his certificate. I was overjoyed. We marched
at 10 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span>; I went in a shigram with a Mrs
R&mdash;&mdash;, Charlie seated on the step, and Mr. R&mdash;&mdash;
in front. Charlie guided the blind coolie with my pony all night by
holding his stick out to him, and the coolie taking the other end
of it. I was more idle, for I slept all night. We went twenty-five
miles.</p>

<p>Friday, December 4th. All very fatigued this morning, Mrs.
B&mdash;&mdash; especially. We got a couple of delicious chickens
and some eggs for <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139"
id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>dinner, a treat we had not enjoyed for
months. We were ordered to march at 9 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span>
Mr. R&mdash;&mdash; had had fever all day, so I gave up my place in the
shigram to him, and Charlie and I travelled in the hackery. We went
thirteen miles this night.</p>

<p>Saturday, December 5th. I felt quite stiff and bruised by the
jolting in the hackery. We asked Mr. C&mdash;&mdash; to bring his
rations, and we would cook them with <a id="corr13"></a>ours, as he had no servants and
got hardly anything yesterday; he says the amount of misery experienced
by the wounded travelling in the rough hackeries is hardly credible,
and many did not get their wounds dressed or have anything to eat the
whole day. There is a sad want of servants and management. We started
again at 7 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span>, having had our hackery
well littered with straw, and went twenty-four miles, not stopping at
Futtehpore, which was half way.</p>

<p>Sunday, December 6th. We got to camp about 9 <span
class="smcap">A.M.</span>; the tents were pitched in a nice tope of
trees. We were ordered on again at 9 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span>,
and had rather a long march; the last mile of it we turned off the
trunk road over a rough track to the railroad, of which we knew
nothing, as we both slept, and on awakening found ourselves at the
temporary terminus.</p>

<p>Monday, December 7th. We hoped to breakfast before we left the
ground; but no, we were <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140"
id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>packed into the railway carriages
immediately, and then were kept waiting three hours for the baggage
to be loaded. Charlie gave up all hope of being able to accompany
us, it was such a time before he could find our baggage and get it
into the train; but it was done at last. We took three hours getting
to Allahabad, stopping once to water the engine, which in this
enlightened country is done by coolies with earthen jars&mdash;the
apparatus not being in order. We luckily had a bottle of porter and
some Native biscuits, so we kept up till we arrived at Allahabad
at 3 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span>, where we met with a most
unexpected reception, the whole station being lined with gentlemen
and soldiers who turned out for the occasion, and cheered us most
lustily; it was almost overpowering. They had done everything they
could for our comfort; all sorts of vehicles had been lent by their
owners to take us from the station to the fort, where a large suite
of the Governor-General's tents, about fifteen in number, had been
pitched for us. We shared a double-poled tent with Captain and Mrs.
R&mdash;&mdash;; it had one public and two private compartments. It was
a great luxury to be quiet by ourselves, after the many months we had
been herded together. Captain D&mdash;&mdash; sent us over a splendid
dinner. We met Dr. H&mdash;&mdash; and S&mdash;&mdash; H&mdash;&mdash;
at the station; all the former could do was to squeeze my hand and say
"Poor thing! poor thing!" Our tents were <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>very comfortably
furnished; so, after taking tea with the R&mdash;&mdash;'s, we went to
bed.</p>

 <p>Tuesday, December 8th. It was such luxury to be in bed, and have
 my chota hazree brought to me, after having had to make it for so
 many months&mdash;almost the whole of the siege&mdash;and it was such
 delicious bread and butter! Mr. S&mdash;&mdash;, the chaplain, and
 some gentlemen, came round to all the tents, early, bringing cakes of
 soap for us; and the night before all our tents were supplied with oil
 lamps. We went over to breakfast in the Mess tent&mdash;it was the
 Governor-General's Durbar tent&mdash;a most splendid one, and pitched
 in the centre of our camp; we had a delicious breakfast&mdash;coffee,
 with rich cream. I enjoyed it much, after our siege fare, and
 was as pleased as a child to get it. We telegraphed to Capt.
 P&mdash;&mdash;, in Calcutta, to write home, and say we were all safe.
 Drs. B&mdash;&mdash; and H&mdash;&mdash;, and Major T&mdash;&mdash;
 called. After this, our days passed quietly at Allahabad. Christmas
 Day, we dined with Capt. J&mdash;&mdash;, of the Fusiliers; and
 Monday, January 11th, left Allahabad in country boats, to join the
 steamers at Sirsa, as none of them could come up higher, on account
 of the shallow water on the Dum-dumma Flats. We had a narrow escape!
 As our boat was alongside the <cite>Charles Allen</cite>, another
 steamer passed, having several Native boats attached to its flat; one
 came with great force against <a id="corr14"></a>ours, and every one expected we were
 done for, as these Native <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142"
 id="Page_142">[142]</a></span> boats generally crush up and go down
 instantaneously. There was a cry, "Save the women and children!" and
 we were dragged up on the top of the paddle-box by our arms; however,
 our boat did not go down, or we must have gone with it. Captain
 F&mdash;&mdash;, of the <cite>Charles Allen</cite>, afterwards told
 me he had expected to see us go down, and thought the poor creatures
 had escaped Lucknow only to meet with another horrible death. We had
 a pleasant trip down the river, and reached Calcutta on Thursday,
 January 28th. We slept that night on board, and the next morning took
 up our abode at 3, Harrington Street&mdash;one of the houses prepared
 by the Relief Fund Committee for the Lucknow refugees, where we found
 everything provided for us in the most luxurious style.</p>
